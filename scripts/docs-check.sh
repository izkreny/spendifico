# Single-source assertions over this repo's Markdown.
#
# Every assertion here corresponds to a fact that was once stated in two places
# and where one copy silently went wrong, or to a break that nothing else could
# see. See docs/agents/conventions.md, "Single-source every fact", for the rule
# they enforce.
#
# POSIX sh + git + grep only: nothing to install, and it runs in well under a
# second. git ls-files is used rather than find because it skips node_modules
# and every gitignored path for free, while still covering dotfiles.
#
# Keep it POSIX. /bin/sh is dash on the CI runner and bash on many developer
# machines, so a bashism passes locally and fails only in CI - which is exactly
# how the first version of this script shipped with a <(...) in it.
#
# Faults are appended to one file rather than a shell variable. Every loop below
# reads a pipe, so its body runs in a subshell where an assignment is discarded
# on exit: the first version needed a whole second pass over two of the checks
# just to set a flag, and the later ones stopped at the first fault per file.

# backend/src/config/env.validation.spec.ts, which asks Joi itself through
# describe() rather than pattern-matching the TypeScript, so all three agree
# transitively. Regexing the schema here as well gave two checks one job with
# two methods, and the weaker method silently missed any key that was not
# indented by exactly two spaces.

# writes it into .env - so it is dropped from both lists.

# ------------------------------------------- 4. Backticked rooted paths exist
# A backticked path anchored at a top-level directory must resolve. Gitignored
# paths are skipped, because the docs correctly discuss files that correctly do
# not exist in a clone (backend/.env, .claude/settings.local.json).
#
# Two further classes are named on purpose and are not expected to exist. Keep
# this list short: every entry is a place the check cannot help you, so an entry
# whose file has since been created is dead weight and gets deleted - both
# CLAUDE.md promotion targets listed here originally have now been promoted for
# real, and only the next named candidate belongs in the list.

# --------------------------------------------- 5. Deliberate copies are wired

# -------------------------------------------------- 7. No unclosed code fence
# An odd number of fence lines means a block never closed, which on GitHub
# swallows every heading and paragraph after it into one grey box. Nothing else

# passes, and the damage is close to invisible in a diff. Two guides shipped
# this way, each having quietly lost the command its empty fence was to hold.

# ------------------------------ 8. Every scoped CLAUDE.md warns about its gaps
# Root CLAUDE.md is the index and deliberately keeps no such list, because a
# shared list of everybody's gaps is the one merge conflict this repo has had.
# Every scoped file is an area guide and must carry one, because a feature that
# was never built looks exactly like a feature you have not found yet. A file
# deeper in the tree may point at its parent's list rather than keep its own,
# since both load together, but it may not stay silent - which is how the
# newest guide shipped covering the least finished area in the repo.
