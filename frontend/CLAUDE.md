# frontend/CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code inside `frontend/`. Root `CLAUDE.md` carries the rules that hold
everywhere and points here; this file is the authority for everything inside the Next.js app.
Runnable detail lives in the guides: commands in `docs/guides/commands.md`, environment values
in `docs/guides/configuration.md`.

## Design tokens

**daisyUI 5 on Tailwind v4 is the design system as of PET-57**, which retired the hand-rolled
Figma-token layer. `frontend/src/app/globals.css` holds the Tailwind import, the daisyUI plugin
registration, the two **Expensa theme blocks** PET-74 authored from the design tokens -
`expensa-light` the default, `expensa-dark` selected automatically from the OS - the two font
tokens, the field-focus rules that swap daisyUI's double focus ring for Claude Design's
single accent one, and the three `-orange` status modifiers PET-74's sixth addendum added
beside them (daisyUI ships no orange, and the budget banding's "Full" band wants one between
`warning` and `error` - the theme blocks define the `--color-orange` pair and those rules are
daisyUI's own `-warning` modifiers transcribed for it). Its comments are the authority for
where every value came from and which four are derivations. There is no `tailwind.config`; Tailwind v4 is configured CSS-first.

### Figma against daisyUI: the division of authority

**Read this before opening the design file. It is not a preference and it is not negotiable** -
it is the decision PET-57's plan rests on, and every one of its three parts has already been
violated once by somebody working from the design file in good faith.

1. **The Figma Foundations and Components pages are dead. Do not work from them, for anything.**
   Foundations documents the retired token layer - the 19 named type styles, the hand-rolled
   palette, the radius and shadow scales - and Components documents a nine-tile set that no
   longer exists. **daisyUI is the component library.** Whatever either page says about colour,
   type, radius, shadow, spacing or how a control is constructed is superseded, and consulting
   them for any of it is precisely how the token layer returns one class at a time.

   Two things this rule deliberately does **not** ask for, so that it needs no sweep to be true.
   **Existing references to those pages stay.** A comment saying `ui/` mirrors the nine tiles, or
   naming node `18:252` as a story's diff target, is a record of why a file sits where it sits -
   history, not an instruction to go and open the page - and rewriting nine such comments would
   change no behaviour and lose the reasoning. Read them as dated. What the rule forbids
   is **new** work taken from either page, and adding a reference of your own to them.

   **Icon geometry used to be exempt from this rule and is not any more.** The exemption existed
   because daisyUI ships no icon set, so a vector export was the only source for a glyph and two
   files traced theirs from the dead Components page. PET-33 added `lucide-react` and migrated
   every glyph onto it, which is the ticket that exemption was waiting for - so a mark now comes
   from the library, never from a Figma node, and the last reason to open either dead page is
   gone. See the icon-library rule under Shared components below.

2. **On the Screens page the split is exact.** Figma governs **structure, layout and content** -
   what is on the screen, in what order, grouped how, with which words. The theme governs
   **colour, type, radius and shadow** - and as of PET-74 the theme is the custom **Expensa
   pair** in `globals.css`, authored from the design tokens with the Claude Design project as
   the token authority, which supersedes PET-57's stock registration and the "never re-theme"
   sentence that stood here. What that rule forbade narrowed rather than died: **never re-theme
   at a call site, and never eyedrop a value from the dead Figma pages** - a colour changes by
   editing the theme blocks and re-running the guard below, nowhere else. `globals.css` holds
   the two `@plugin 'daisyui/theme'` blocks, the two font variables, the field-focus rules
   (PET-74's fourth addendum: daisyUI's border-plus-offset-outline focus read as a double
   border, and Claude Design's single accent ring replaces it - the file's own comment carries
   the account, including why an error field's ring stays error-coloured) and the sixth
   addendum's `-orange` status modifiers, and that is still the
   whole of what it may ever contain. The colour rule below is the same prohibition from the
   other end, because a raw `text-red-600` is re-theming by hand, one element at a time.

3. **Match the frame as closely as those boundaries allow, and build it with the daisyUI
   Blueprint MCP.** Closeness is measured in structure, layout and content; it is never measured
   in hex values, pixel radii or shadow spreads, and a diff against the frame that reports those
   as defects is reporting the design system working. Two standing carve-outs, both already
   exercised across this app: the frames are a fixed 1440px and draw no narrow viewport, so a
   designed fixed width becomes a `max-w-*` ceiling rather than a `w-*`; and where a frame draws
   no state at all - focus, disabled, pending, empty, error - that state is ours to invent, and
   `docs/TODO.md` tracks the sign-offs A19 and A29 owe for the ones already shipped. The MCP's
   three stages earn three different levels of trust, which `docs/agents/claude-tooling.md` sets
   out; do not treat its inspector as an authority over any of the above.

Four rules keep the rest coherent:

- **Theme-aware colour is daisyUI semantic colour, never a raw palette class.** The names are
  `base-100/200/300`, `base-content`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `neutral`, `info`,
  `success`, `warning` and `error`, each with a `-content` pair for what sits on it. Tailwind's
  full palette is back, so `text-red-600` now compiles and quietly bypasses the theme - the
  exact inversion of the old failure, where a wrong class generated nothing. The compile-time
  check died with the token layer, so this rests on review. `orange` is the one app-authored
  name beside daisyUI's own, PET-74's "Full" band hue: the theme blocks define the
  `--color-orange` pair, and `badge-orange`, `status-orange` and `progress-orange` in
  `globals.css` are its only three classes. Reach for those rather than minting a fourth, and
  note Tailwind's own `orange-50` to `orange-950` scale stays as forbidden as the rest of the
  raw palette - `text-orange-600` is not the theme's orange, however close it looks.

- **Never write a `dark:` variant.** Semantic colours resolve through the active theme, so dark
  mode needs nothing from markup, and a `dark:` override would fight the theme instead of
  following it.

- **Colour modifiers are semantic state, not decoration.** `btn-primary` marks the one
  emphasized action per screen; `btn-error`, `input-error` and `text-error` mark destructive
  actions and invalid state. The three status colours still carry meaning: reaching for one
  because a design asks for that hue says something the interface did not intend.

- **Class strings stay complete literals.** Tailwind's scanner reads source as raw text, so an
  interpolated `bg-${tone}` compiles to nothing with no build error. Variant maps keep whole
  strings per key (`ui/categoryColour.ts` is the pattern), and daisyUI modifiers are literal
  classes in markup.

Typography: the two families load through `next/font/google` in `frontend/src/app/fonts.ts`,
whose variable classes must stay on `<html>` - that is where `:root` resolves, and both
`.storybook/preview.ts` and the root layout apply them. `--font-sans` (Inter) is what Tailwind's
preflight reads as the default body family; `font-display` (Plus Jakarta Sans) is the heading
and wordmark face. Type sizes are Tailwind's own scale (`text-sm`, `text-2xl`); the 19 named
Figma type styles are gone.

**PET-79's typography audit replaced the display face with Crimson Pro and kept Inter, so read
"Plus Jakarta Sans" above as history.** Two constraints decided it and neither is visible in a
side-by-side, which is the reason to read them before proposing a third face. A display face needs
**real weights**, because 28 of the 29 `font-display` sites pair it with `font-bold` or
`font-semibold` and a single-weight family gets synthesized bold at every one - which is what ruled
out the logo artwork's own IM Fell English SC. A body face needs a **`tnum` feature**, because six
sites depend on `tabular-nums` and the class is inert without one; Quicksand, Nunito, Source Sans 3
and IBM Plex Sans all lack it. `docs/explainers/generators/font-metrics.json` holds every figure,
measured from the font binaries, and `font-probe.js` beside it re-derives them and fails on drift.

**The one mechanical cost is that every heading size had to move.** Crimson Pro's caps are 76.9% of
Plus Jakarta Sans's at the same font-size (0.5732 against 0.7450), so matching them optically means
x1.300 - and **not uniformly one step**, which is the trap: Tailwind's scale is not geometric, and
steps 2px at a time up to `text-xl` (14 / 16 / 18 / 20) before widening after it (24 / 30 / 36 / 48).
So **every size below `text-xl` moves two steps and `text-xl` and up move one**, which is four call
sites in the first group: one `text-base` -> `text-xl`, three `text-lg` -> `text-2xl`.
An earlier draft of this paragraph said `text-lg` alone moved two and "everything else moves one",
and sent the reader to a table in this file that has never existed; both are corrected in place
rather than left dated, on the same ground the `lib/pickerScroll.ts` path below is - a reader sent
to something that is not there learns nothing. `app/fonts.ts` carries the arithmetic.
The hero on `app/WelcomeScreen.tsx` is the one place the ramp runs out (60px wants 78, against
`text-7xl`'s 72 and `text-8xl`'s 96) and takes the nearer rather than an off-scale literal. No gate
can see any of this: every one of those classes compiles either way.

**And the wordmark is no longer a `font-display` call site at all.** `components/LogoLockup.tsx` is
one component for every place the brand appears, replacing three hand-copied lockups - two the plan
named and a third, wordmark-only one in `(app)/layout.tsx`'s drawer bar that it missed. Its sizes are
derived from the trimmed artwork rather than chosen, and the file records the container constraint
that stops the largest ratio being usable everywhere.

**Light and dark both ship, and the Settings Preferences card carries the app's one theme
control as of PET-74's addendum**: a three-way System / Light / Dark segmented radio group,
persisting in the `spendifico.theme` cookie the root layout stamps `<html data-theme>` from.
This closes rather than violates the old "no controller" rule, which existed because a two-way
toggle and automatic prefers-dark cannot coexist - the `system` arm is the coexistence, meaning
"no `data-theme` attribute at all", which is exactly the state daisyUI's prefers-dark selector
(`:root:not([data-theme])`) requires. `lib/theme.ts` owns the mechanism and
`settings/ThemeField.tsx` the control; do not add a second controller elsewhere, and note a
`data-theme` value must be a **registered theme's name** - `app/DecorativePanel.tsx` records how
an unregistered one fails silently.

**PET-79 replaces that segmented row with a six-tile picker, and widens the union to five themes.**
The paragraph above is right about the mechanism and dated about the control: `system` still means no
attribute, the root layout still stamps it from the same cookie, and the choice still never travels
in the PATCH. What changed is that a three-way row cannot offer a _choice of themes_, so the
Preferences card now draws one tile per registered theme plus Automatic - **each tile wearing its own
`data-theme`**, so its eight swatches paint that theme's real values through the same semantic
classes the app uses. No hex is written and a theme edit updates every swatch for free.

Two consequences worth knowing before touching either file. `themeAttribute` is a **lookup rather
than two branches**, because every preference except `system` now _is_ a registered theme name - so
there is no mapping table to keep in step with the CSS. And that lands one **deliberate behaviour
change**: the cookie value `light` meant `expensa-light` under PET-74 and means daisyUI's own `light`
now, so a browser holding the old cookie lands on a different theme once. Nothing is migrated, there
being no real users and test accounts being purged, and `lib/theme.test.ts` pins the collision so a
"fix" that mapped them back cannot quietly make the app's own pair unreachable.

**`ThemeField` also writes the `theme-color` meta tag, which is not scope creep but the only place it
can be done.** A manifest carries one static colour and `<meta name="theme-color">` varies only by
media query, never by a cookie-driven attribute - so `layout.tsx` renders a `prefers-color-scheme`
pair, right for Automatic and wrong for an explicit pick that disagrees with the OS, and the control
overwrites both tags on a pick. `lib/theme.ts`'s `THEME_COLOUR` is the one place a theme value is
restated outside `globals.css`, and `themeGuard.test.ts` pins all five against the themes' own
`base-100`.

### Changing or adding a theme: the category palette is the guard

**A theme is not a private decision of `globals.css`. It repaints seventeen category colours at
once, and two committed artifacts are what say whether the result is usable.** Read this before
registering a third daisyUI theme, before swapping either of the two that ship, and before any
change that moves what a `--color-*` resolves to.

- `docs/explainers/category-palette-preview.html` draws all **seventeen** allowlist tokens as the
  marks the app really paints them as, with the measured contrast beside each, **and** the
  **thirteen** categories a real account shows - under a switcher carrying every installed theme.

  It was two pages until PET-79, `category-color-palette-preview.html` and
  `category-colors-icons-description-preview.html`, each pinning one theme pair in a
  hand-maintained `<style>` block. Neither exists; they are named here because the rest of this
  section still describes them and git history is where they went. **Named without their
  `docs/explainers/` prefix deliberately**, because `npm run docs:check` verifies that every
  directory-qualified path a doc names actually resolves - and it caught this paragraph's first
  draft doing exactly that. A bare filename is a reference to history; a path is a claim the file
  is there.

Both are stock HTML pinned to the installed daisyUI, Tailwind and lucide, so opening one in a
browser is the whole procedure. As of PET-74 each explainer also embeds the Expensa theme values
in its own `<style>` block, because the CDN `daisyui.css` carries only the stock themes - so a
theme edit is not done until every explainer's block matches `globals.css`, and nothing checks
that they do. **Open both under the new theme and satisfy three conditions
before the theme lands.** First, every one of the seventeen tokens has to stay **distinguishable
from every other**, because a picker offering two colours that paint the same is a picker with
sixteen entries and a lie in it - two pairs are already deliberately close (`categoryColour.ts`
names them with their measured ΔE, beside the third pair PET-74's hues separated), so a theme
that collapses a third pair is spending margin
that was already spent. Second, every colour has to stay **visible against `bg-base-100`** as an
8px dot, not merely as a 36px tile: that is the mark a theme change breaks first, and the whole
reason both files draw the small marks at all. Third, every tile's glyph has to stay legible on
its own background, which is what the `-content` pairing buys and what a re-themed palette can
silently take away.

**None of that is checked by anything.** No build, no lint, no Jest run and no CI job reads a
colour, `COLOUR_CONTRAST` is documentation with a type on it rather than a runtime assertion, and
the frontend's exhaustiveness proofs catch a missing _key_ while saying nothing about the value.
So a theme that makes six categories look identical ships entirely green. That is the failure this
guard exists for, and it is the same failure `backend/CLAUDE.md` records for `warning-content`:
the claim "a semantic token is theme-aware and therefore safe" is false, was written down anyway,
and was caught by measuring rather than by reasoning.

**Re-measure rather than reuse the numbers.** Both files carry measured figures, and a new theme
invalidates every one of them - `COLOUR_CONTRAST`
in `backend/src/database/central/template-tokens.ts` is where the table lives and where a
re-measurement belongs. Compositing matters: a token carrying an alpha means nothing until it is
painted over the card and the pixel is read, so a check that stops at `getComputedStyle` has not
checked `base-content/50`. And if a theme genuinely cannot carry seventeen distinguishable
colours, the answer is to change the palette in `COLOUR_SEED` and re-run both files, not to ship
the theme and let the categories collide.

**PET-79 automated all of this, so read everything above as the procedure it replaced.** Five
sentences in it are now false rather than dated, and it is worth saying which: the two named files
no longer exist, "None of that is checked by anything" is the opposite of true, and "the answer is
to change the palette in `COLOUR_SEED`" is a rule the product owner closed off. The rest - what the
three conditions are, and why - is unchanged and is still the reason any of it exists.

**The gate is `frontend/src/lib/themeGuard.test.ts` and the measurement is `lib/themeGuard.ts`.**
`cd frontend && npm run theme:report` prints the human-facing tables and writes the one committed
artifact, `docs/explainers/category-palette/theme-data.json`. The suite fails on a colliding pair
that is not one of the two `GRANDFATHERED_PAIRS`, on a `-content` value that has stopped being
legible on its own base, on `base-content/50` dropping under 3:1 against any theme's card, and on
that artifact going stale. So **a theme edit now fails `npm run test` until the report is re-run and
the JSON committed**, which is the behaviour the old procedure could only ask for politely.

**Five themes ship, not two**: `expensa-light` (the `:root` default) and `expensa-dark` (`--prefersdark`)
plus daisyUI's stock `light`, `dark` and `abyss`, each behind token overrides. **`globals.css` may
now contain one more thing than the list above allows** - plain unlayered `[data-theme='<name>']`
blocks overriding individual tokens in a registered stock theme. Seven declarations across three
themes today. They are unlayered deliberately, which is what makes them win over daisyUI's layered
theme rules, and each carries its measured before-and-after in a comment. That file's own header is
the authority for why they exist and how the values were chosen; do not re-pick one by eye.

**The card-contrast floor the old procedure implies is unsatisfiable, and the guard deliberately
does not assert it.** Only **three** of the seventeen tokens clear 3:1 in every theme - `primary`,
`secondary` and `base-content/50` - because daisyUI puts each `-content` at the opposite end of the
lightness range from its base, which is exactly what makes it legible on its own tile and
near-invisible on the page's own surface somewhere. That is a property of the pairing rather than of
any assignment, so it cannot be fixed by re-picking a colour, and PET-64 accepted it on the record.
The guard therefore **pins those figures against drift and floors only `base-content/50`**, the one
token with a recorded reason to be visible as bare colour. A case in the suite pins the _absence_ of
the wider floor, the way `layout.test.tsx` pins the absence of a `force-dynamic` export, so somebody
reaching for it meets this argument first.

**What the guard cannot see, and why the browser walk stays in every theme ticket.** It measures
authored values, so it is blind to anything that never reaches the paint: a losing cascade rule, a
theme name nobody registered (`app/DecorativePanel.tsx` shipped that once), an alpha applied at a
call site. It was itself calibrated in a browser - all one hundred token-theme pairs painted on a
1x1 canvas and read back, agreeing on 97 exactly and the rest within one byte. **The trap that
found**: daisyUI's build emits an sRGB hex fallback beside each wide-gamut `lab()` value, the
fallback is dead code in any browser that matters, and matching it instead of what Chromium paints
would have reported a collision that does not exist. The sRGB fallback beside a wide-gamut colour is
not what paints.

**The two explainers became one generated page.** `docs/explainers/category-palette-preview.html`
draws all seventeen tokens _and_ all thirteen categories with a **theme switcher that enumerates
whatever is installed**, built by `docs/explainers/category-palette/build-palette-page.js` over the
same artifact and checked by its sibling. Two pages each pinning one theme pair was a maintenance
cost at two themes and a page that lies at five. Three explainers still embed the Expensa values by
hand, and `themeGuard.test.ts` diffs those blocks against `globals.css` - which closes the
`docs/TODO.md` entry that asked for it.

## Where daisyUI and Tailwind fight

**Every entry below is a class that is present in the markup and paints nothing**, and not one
of them can fail a build, a lint or a Jest run. That is the same inversion the colour rule above
describes, and it is the whole reason this section exists: under the token layer a wrong class
generated no CSS and the compile harness caught it, and now a wrong class generates CSS that
loses. Each of these cost a review finding on PET-57 or its incorporation, verified against
`frontend/node_modules/daisyui/components/*.css` rather than reasoned about - **read that CSS
when a daisyUI class does not do what its name says**, because the plugin ships the compiled
rules and they answer these questions in one grep.

- **Two modifiers from the same daisyUI component in one class string are resolved by the
  plugin's emission order, not by yours.** They land at equal specificity in the same cascade
  layer, so the later rule in `button.css` wins whatever the attribute says. The worked example
  is `btn-ghost btn-outline`: `.btn-outline` sets `--btn-border` to the button's colour
  and `.btn-ghost` sets it to transparent, ghost is emitted second, and the outline never
  renders - which is how `(app)/DateField.tsx`'s "today" marker was pixel-identical to a plain
  day with `toHaveClass('btn-outline')` green. A **colour** modifier is safe to pair with a
  style one, because `btn-primary` only sets `--btn-color` and `--btn-fg`, which the style
  modifier reads: `btn-outline btn-primary` is the supported combination and is what that file
  uses now. Two style modifiers is the mistake.

- **A daisyUI `:focus` rule sets `--tw-outline-style: none`, and Tailwind's `outline-2` reads
  that variable.** So `focus-visible:outline-2` alone computes to a 2px outline of style `none`
  and there is no focus ring at all - a WCAG 2.4.7 failure that looks correct in the diff, has
  the right colour class beside it, and is invisible to every gate. **Any restored focus ring
  needs `focus-visible:outline-solid` too.** `.link` and `.menu` both do this; assume the next
  component does as well. `ui/Sidebar.tsx` and `app/WelcomeScreen.tsx` are the two call sites,
  and the app currently has no `outline-2` anywhere without its `outline-solid`.

- **daisyUI sets no cursor on a resting `select`, so `cursor-pointer` is not redundant.**
  `select.css` sets `not-allowed` when the control is disabled and `pointer` on an `<option>`
  inside the picker, and nothing else - an enabled select keeps the user agent's arrow and reads
  as inert. `btn` does carry one, which is why this is easy to assume. PET-10 fixed this
  app-wide once; `ui/Select.tsx` holds the constant, and `(app)/DateField.tsx`'s `<button>`
  trigger and the transactions filter pills each state it too.

- **`fieldset` is `display: grid`, so `self-start` on a child does nothing.** The class is a
  one-column `1fr` grid, where the horizontal axis is `justify-self` and `align-self` is the
  block axis - so a label that shrank to its text under a `flex flex-col` parent stretches to
  full width the moment the same markup moves onto `fieldset`, and every click in the invisible
  strip beside the word is forwarded to the control. `ui/FieldShell.tsx` records what that looks
  like on a `<select>` and its suite pins the fix.

- **The `<fieldset>` element is not the `fieldset` class.** The element publishes
  `role="group"`, and daisyUI's own idiom is one of them around a _set_ of fields named by a
  `legend.fieldset-legend`. Wrapping a single control in the element gives every field in the
  app its own nameless group boundary, announced entering and leaving. The class is pure CSS and
  works on a `div`, which is what `ui/FieldShell.tsx` uses.

- **`status` draws a drop shadow from `currentColor`**, and sets `color` to a translucent black
  for exactly that purpose. Handing it a class pair that includes a `text-*-content` half turns
  that shadow into an opaque coloured smudge. This is why `ui/categoryColour.ts` exports
  `CATEGORY_DOT` beside `CATEGORY_TILE`: a `text-*` class is inert on a mark with no content
  only where nothing reads `currentColor`, and a surprising number of daisyUI components do.

- **`modal-box` animates through the `scale` property, which makes it a containing block for
  `position: fixed` descendants.** The one defect of this migration that a browser walk caught
  and nothing else could; `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` owns the account of it, under The app
  shell, along with the `translate-none scale-none` that pays for it.

- **A `<progress>`'s track is a tint of its own fill, so a coloured bar at 0% is a solid coloured
  pill.** `.progress` sets `background-color: color-mix(in oklab, currentcolor 20%, transparent)`
  and every `progress-*` modifier sets `currentcolor` - so `progress-success` paints a 20% green
  track, and a category with nothing spent read as a full green bar rather than an empty grey one.
  This is the first entry in this section that is a _visible_ wrong result rather than an invisible
  missing one, and it still could not fail a gate: `toHaveClass('progress-success')` is green either
  way. **Pin the track with `bg-base-300`**, which is the token an empty surface should be and what
  `transactions/[id]/CategoryContextCard.tsx`'s div-based bar already uses. The three call sites are
  `transactions/categories/categoryCardStatus.ts`, `transactions/categories/SpendingSummaryCard.tsx`
  and `dashboard/BudgetCard.tsx`; `app/DecorativePanel.tsx` needs nothing, because it carries no
  colour modifier and its `currentcolor` is already `base-content`.

- **daisyUI ships `.card-body p { flex-grow: 1 }`, so `justify-between` does nothing in a card
  footer whose children are both `<p>`.** Both stretch, there is no free space left to distribute,
  and each paragraph's text renders at the left edge of its own over-wide box - so a figure meant to
  sit against the card's right edge sits in the middle of the row instead. It bit the Categories
  card's transaction count and the dashboard budget card's "days left" caption, and every row beside
  them escaped it only because their right-hand child is a `<span>` or an `<a>`, which the selector
  does not match. **Fix it with `text-right` rather than `grow-0`**: the plugin's selector is (0,1,1)
  against a utility's (0,1,0), so it wins on specificity rather than on layer order and the utility
  loses - measured in Chrome, where adding `grow-0` left `flex-grow` computing to `1`. `text-right`
  sets a property daisyUI never touches, so there is nothing to outrank. Keep the
  `justify-between`: it is what positions the boxes the moment either child stops growing.

  **The same rule bites on the block axis, and there `text-right`'s trick has no counterpart -
  PET-78 found it pushing the donut's centre readout out of the ring's hole.**
  `dashboard/CategoryDonut.tsx` centres the period's total over the hole with an
  `absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center` overlay holding two lines, and the
  overlay is inside `.card-body`, so as `<p>`s each line grew to half the overlay's height and
  rendered its text at the **top** of its own half. Measured on `/dashboard`: the amount's box 104px
  tall against a 32px line, its centre **44px** above the hole's, the caption's **52px** below, and
  neither line fitting inside the 67.2px hole radius - against 8px and 16px, both fitting, once
  fixed. **The deceptive part is that the pair as a group stays perfectly centred**, the midpoint
  measuring 0px off the hole's centre before and after, so nothing is off-centre and the two lines
  are simply shoved apart - which is why it reads as a positioning mystery rather than as a flex
  defect, and why the horizontal case above was found first despite being the subtler one. There is
  no block-axis `text-right`, because the property that has to lose _is_ `flex-grow`: an override
  needs (0,1,1) or better, and `[&_p]:grow-0` on the parent ties daisyUI's own specificity and is
  decided by emission order, which is this list's first entry. **So the fix is structural - stop the
  lines being `<p>`** (a `<span>` is blockified by the flex container and stacks identically, and the
  selector does not match it), or wrap them in a `<div>`, where `flex-grow` is inert because the
  children of a block container are not flex items. The general rule to carry: **inside a
  `.card-body`, a `<p>` is a flex item that grows on whichever axis its parent runs**, so a
  paragraph is the wrong element for anything being centred rather than filled.

  **And `text-right` is the right fix for exactly one of the three shapes, which PET-78 found by
  reaching for it and watching it make things worse.** It relocates the text inside the grown box, so
  it works only where the intended position _is_ an edge - the "days left" caption above, which is
  meant to reach the card's right edge. The dashboard's budget readout is the other row shape: a
  `flex items-baseline gap-2` holding "€3,898" and "of €5,000", which are meant to read as **one
  sentence**, and as `<p>`s each grew to half the row so `gap-2` sat between two boxes rather than
  between two numbers - measured at **238.9px** between the two figures against the **8px** the class
  asks for, restored to exactly 8px by making both `<span>`s. Pushing the second one right would have
  moved it _further_ from the first. So: **where the intended position is an edge, align the text;
  where two items are meant to be adjacent or centred, nothing about alignment can help and the
  element has to stop being a `<p>`.** A browser sweep of all six signed-in screens for the rule
  found 41 more flex-item paragraphs and **no further defect** - 27 of them are the first child of a
  `justify-between` row, which grows and is still correct, so slack alone is not the test: the defect
  needs a later, start-aligned child. `docs/plans/2026-08-12_PET-78_dashboard-ui-ux-fixups.md` carries
  the sweep's method and the false start that produced it.

- **The page canvas is `bg-base-200`, and `base-200` is also what daisyUI paints its two neutral
  surfaces - so a control on the canvas can be invisible with no class of its own being wrong.**
  `app/layout.tsx` paints the canvas; `textarea.css` fills **and borders** a disabled `textarea`
  with `base-200`, and `button.css` sets `--btn-bg` to `var(--btn-color, var(--color-base-200))`, so
  a `.btn` with no colour modifier fills with it too. **The Expensa themes are what make the button
  half total rather than faint**, and it is worth knowing which half is the theme's: `--btn-border`
  is `color-mix(in oklab, base-200, #000 calc(var(--depth) * 5%))`, and both theme blocks set
  `--depth: 0` because the design is flat - so the border resolves to `base-200` exactly and there
  is no hairline left to see the button by. Under a theme with depth it would have been a faint box
  rather than nothing. The disabled `textarea` needs no such help, setting `border-color` to
  `base-200` outright. daisyUI assumes both sit on a
  `base-100` card, which every form in this app did until the assistant composer floated directly
  on the canvas. Two defects, one cause, both PET-76's: the composer's message box **vanished
  outright for the whole of a turn** - fill, border and all, on the one control the user is waiting
  on - and "New chat" had no visible box at all and read as bold text somebody forgot to link.
  Note what makes this class of defect worse than the ones above: there is no losing class to find
  in the attribute, because nothing is wrong with the markup in isolation. **Fix it by putting the
  control on a `base-100` card**, which is what `insights/AssistantComposer.tsx` does, or by giving
  it a colour of its own (`NewChat.tsx`'s `variant="primary"`). Do **not** reach for
  `disabled:bg-base-100`: that lands at equal specificity against daisyUI's own rule and is resolved
  by emission order rather than by the attribute, which is the fight the first entry in this list
  describes. **PET-76's walk measured that override rather than trusting the prediction, and the
  prediction was wrong in a way worth keeping**: `disabled:bg-base-100` **does** apply - Tailwind
  emits it unlayered inside `utilities` where daisyUI's rule sits in a nested sub-layer, which is the
  precedence `ui/Sidebar.tsx` already records winning - and what it wins is a field filled with the
  card's own colour, measured at **1.000:1** against it. So the advice stands and its reason
  inverts: not "the override loses" but "the override applies and re-creates the defect". The
  general rule to carry: **before styling anything that sits directly on the canvas,
  check what daisyUI's default fill for it is** - `secondary` in `ui/Button.tsx` maps to a bare
  `.btn`, so any `secondary` button on a canvas has this bug by construction. There is no other one
  in the app today, which is why PET-76 fixed one call site rather than sweeping.

  **The measured figures, because the fix is judged against the design rather than against a
  threshold.** On its card the disabled field reads **1.075:1** in light and **1.099:1** in dark, and
  those are not weak numbers needing an excuse - they are _exactly_ the ratio this design separates
  every `base-100` card from the `base-200` canvas with, on every screen. A floor invented above them
  would condemn the app's own card edges. What changed is the other end: on the canvas the disabled
  field measured **1.000:1**, fill and border both, byte-identical to what was behind it. The plain
  `.btn` measured the same 1.000:1, against **5.851:1** for `btn-primary`. So the check to write for
  this class of defect is "is it distinct at all, and by the design's own step", never a WCAG floor -
  a disabled control is exempt from 1.4.11 anyway, and `cursor: not-allowed` plus the dimmed
  placeholder carry the state beside the fill.

- **Two neutral surface tokens one step apart are not a contrast pair, and which of them is lighter
  flips between the two themes.** The canvas entry above is this rule where one of the two surfaces
  is the page; this is the same fact with both of them inside a component, and it is worse because
  the failure is **theme-dependent rather than absent**. `table-zebra` paints every even row
  `base-200` and `.chat-bubble` is `base-300`, so the markdown table in an assistant reply
  (`insights/AssistantMarkdown.tsx`) drew a stripe measuring **1.072:1 in `expensa-light`** -
  invisible, below the `1.115`/`1.152` this file already records as rejected - and **1.277:1 in
  `expensa-dark`**, where `base-200` is the _darker_ of the two and the stripe genuinely paints. So a
  walk in one theme reports a defect and a walk in the other reports a working stripe, and both are
  right. **A class whose visibility depends on the reader's OS setting is the defect**, not a weak
  one to be strengthened: the rows are distinguished or they are not. The fix was to delete the
  modifier and let `.table`'s own bottom border carry it, measured at **1.114:1 light / 1.170:1
  dark** - one mechanism behaving the same in both themes, where in dark the border and the deleted
  stripe were within 0.1 of each other anyway. Two things generalise. **A stripe or tint inside a
  coloured component wants a `base-content` alpha rather than a surface token**, which is the call
  `AssistantMarkdown`'s `code` mapping already made beside it. And **the comment justifying that
  call had the token wrong** - it said the bubble "_is_ `base-200`" where `chat.css` sets
  `base-300` - which is what let the table repeat the mistake four lines below a paragraph warning
  against it: a reader checking `table-zebra`'s `base-200` against that sentence finds `base-200` on
  `base-200`, concludes it is impossible, and moves on. **Read the plugin's CSS for the token rather
  than the neighbouring comment.**

- **`loading-*` is not a CSS animation and cannot be tuned from CSS at all.** It reads exactly like
  a class whose speed an `animation-duration` beside it would change, and that utility reaches
  nothing: `loading.css` implements the mark as a `mask-image` **data-URI SVG** carrying SMIL
  `<animate>` elements, so the timing lives inside a URL where no class, no theme variable and no
  utility can touch it. `loading-dots` runs `dur='3s'` with `keyTimes='0;0.286;0.571;1'`, which
  means each dot hops once inside the first 57% of the timeline and then holds still for roughly 1.3
  seconds - so the assistant's typing indicator read as a decoration rather than as activity, and
  the obvious fix was unreachable. `loading-*` also carries a **size** (`loading-sm` and friends)
  that a `size-*` utility does not override, for the same reason. **Replace it with real CSS
  animation when the timing matters**, which `insights/TypingIndicator.tsx` does with three
  `animate-bounce` spans staggered by negative `[animation-delay]`. One arithmetic trap in doing so:
  Tailwind's `bounce` keyframes translate by `-25%` of the **element's own height**, so a 6px dot
  travels 1.5px and reproduces the static-looking indicator from the other direction - daisyUI's own
  mark travels a full dot diameter, which is why that file animates a `size-4` box around a
  `size-1.5` dot. Measured: **3.88px of travel against the 4.00px the keyframes promise**, on all
  three dots, where a bare dot would have managed 1.50px.

  **Measuring an animation needs frame sampling, not a timer**, which is worth knowing before writing
  the check rather than after. PET-76's walk first sampled every 80ms over a 960ms cycle and reported
  2.84px of travel; at 35ms it reported 3.58px. Both were facts about the sampling interval straddling
  a dot's phase rather than about the animation, and both looked exactly like a real defect. Sample
  inside `requestAnimationFrame` for longer than one full cycle - roughly 74 composited frames here -
  and assert against the amplitude the keyframes promise for that box rather than against a pixel
  floor somebody chose.

**The daisyUI Blueprint MCP is this repo's method for writing that markup, and its three stages
earn three different levels of trust** - follow the syntax stage verbatim, adjudicate the quality
inspector's findings rather than applying them, and treat the browser walk as the real output.
`docs/agents/claude-tooling.md` is the single home for all three and for the false positives this
codebase reliably produces; read it before running the server, not after.

**Every trap above was found in a browser and none of them by a gate, so the walk is the check.**
That means headless Chromium over the DevTools protocol, reading computed style and the
accessibility tree - and probing the old classes in the same run, so the check is seen to fail
before it is trusted. Prefer it over anything that drives a human's browser. The method, the four
gotchas (colour arrives as `oklab`, headless starts light, `next/font` needs network, Storybook
does not reach the gated screens) and how to get story ids are all in
`docs/agents/claude-tooling.md`.

### The Blueprint MCP's findings are not evidence about this codebase

The daisyUI Blueprint MCP is useful and its `quality_inspector` stage is the one to distrust.
It is **composition-blind**: it reads a class list without the cascade, the theme layer or the
component tree around it, so a finding can be accurate about the attribute and wrong about
what renders. Verify every one of them against this file before editing on it.

The false positives it produces here are false **because of the conventions above**, which is
why this warning lives in this file rather than travelling with the tool. It flags semantic
daisyUI colour as missing a literal palette value, when theme-aware colour is the rule; it
flags the losing half of a modifier pair as dead when the whole point of _Where daisyUI and
Tailwind fight_ is that the losing class is still in the attribute; and it reads the Expensa
theme pair's `--color-*` remapping as a broken token reference. In another project those same
findings might be real, so do not carry this conclusion to one.

Follow the server's own sequencing and syntax verbatim - it is prescriptive - and end with
the browser walk described above rather than with the inspector's verdict. Static analysis
does not know what paints.

## Shared components

`frontend/src/components/CLAUDE.md` is the authority: what earns a file there, the four `ui/`
primitives and two helpers, the six direct children, and the three conventions they follow. It
loads whenever you read a file under `src/components/`, so read it before adding or changing one
rather than reasoning from this file - the bar a wrapper has to clear is the whole reason six
components were deleted in PET-57.

Two rules stated there are reached from outside that folder often enough to name here. **The rule
of three**: duplicate rather than share until a third consumer appears, then lift it into one
owner - `lib/session.ts`'s `authorizedGet` and `components/FormError.tsx` are the two worked
examples. And **tests assert behaviour and semantics, not class strings**, with daisyUI's state
classes the one exception, as the visible half of an aria attribute the same test pins.

**`lucide-react` is the icon library, and there are no hand-traced glyphs left.** Every mark in
the app was a hand-drawn inline `<svg>` with its Figma node id in the comment until PET-33
introduced the dependency and migrated all thirteen. **PET-64 added the one case where a glyph
is chosen at runtime rather than imported at a call site**: a category carries an icon _name_,
and `ui/categoryColour.ts`'s `CATEGORY_ICON` is the static map that turns sixty-four of them into
components - thirteen at PET-64, the rest added by PET-65 so a user naming a category of their own
is not forced to reuse a glyph a seeded category already carries. Reach for that map rather than `lucide-react`'s own barrel - `icons[name]` works and
pulls every glyph the library ships into the bundle - and note the map is keyed by the
contract's published enum, so it is an exhaustiveness proof rather than a lookup table. It is named here rather than in
`frontend/src/components/CLAUDE.md` because routes draw glyphs too - `(app)/layout.tsx`'s
hamburger and `(app)/DateField.tsx`'s month arrows are not components. Import the icon, size it
with a Tailwind `size-*` class, and pass `aria-hidden="true"` **explicitly**: lucide renders a
bare `<svg>` with no ARIA of its own, and several suites assert that attribute on a glyph. Do not
reintroduce a traced SVG for a mark the library already has; the two that legitimately stay
hand-made are `app/icon.svg` (the favicon) and `components/LogoLockup.tsx` (the brand mark, which
must not follow an icon set at all).

Two consequences worth knowing. Lucide is **stroke-based throughout**, so a filled mark is not
available without fighting the library - which is why the sidebar reads lighter than Figma draws
it, and `docs/TODO.md` records that deviation as owing a designer's sign-off. And every icon
carries `'use client'` internally, which costs nothing here: a Server Component may render one
and stays a Server Component, so `ui/Sidebar`, `ui/Button` and `(app)/layout.tsx` all still
render on the server with icons in them.

## The chart library

**Recharts is how a chart is drawn in this app, as of PET-22's retrofit.** Before it, the two
dashboard charts were hand-rolled and PET-22's plan argued that at length for the whole epic; the
reversal and what survives it are in `docs/plans/2026-08-06_PET-22_weekly-spending-trend.md`. The
short version is that the argument was right about one chart and wrong about its scope. Do not
hand-roll a new chart, and do not add a second charting library.

**It is MIT, and the obvious alternative is not.** The daisyUI Blueprint MCP recommends
ApexCharts and its skill guide presents the paid tier as a watermark on a few premium features.
The `LICENSE` in the published package says something else: ApexCharts 6 is dual-licensed on
**organisation revenue**, free only below $2M a year, with a further paid tier for
redistribution. Read a licence out of the tarball before adopting a dependency on a tool's
recommendation, and note the Blueprint server will keep recommending it - `docs/agents/claude-tooling.md`
already sets out which of its stages earn how much trust.

**It is not cheap, and the number is on record so nobody has to guess.** Recharts 3 brings
`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`, `immer`, `reselect` and `victory-vendor` (five d3 packages).
Built client chunks went from 879,657 to 1,230,462 bytes on the branch that added it: **+343 KB,
+40%**. The second chart is nearly free and the first was not, which is the whole reason it is
worth using for the second.

Four rules for writing one, each of which cost something to learn:

- **A chart is a client component and the card around it is not.** Recharts measures its own box
  through a `ResizeObserver`, so it cannot render on the server. Push the boundary into the
  smallest wrapper - `(app)/dashboard/TrendChart.tsx` is the pattern - and keep the heading, the
  caption and anything a screen reader needs as server-rendered HTML beside it. This does not
  make the library cheaper in the bundle; it keeps the card's text assertable and available
  before hydration.

- **Colour goes in as `var(--color-*)` on a `fill`, never as a Tailwind class.** `fill` is an SVG
  presentation attribute and a class string is not a valid value for one, so `CATEGORY_DOT`'s
  habit of handing out whole `bg-*` literals does not transfer. A `var()` reference in the
  attribute is resolved by the browser exactly as the class would be, so it follows the theme
  with no JavaScript and needs no `dark:` variant - confirmed by flipping
  `prefers-color-scheme` mid-walk and watching the computed fill change. An alpha is a separate
  `fillOpacity`, and a translucent fill still has to be **composited and measured**, because
  `getComputedStyle` reports it uncomposited.

- **`accessibilityLayer={false}`, explicitly.** It defaults to **`true`** in Recharts 3, and
  declining to enable something is not the same as disabling it. Left alone it puts
  `role="application"` and `tabindex="0"` on the `<svg>`: a tab stop on a card that has no
  keyboard interface, and a role telling assistive technology to leave browse mode and forward
  every key to it. It is worse inside an `aria-hidden` plot, which is the ordinary arrangement
  here, because `aria-hidden` does not remove focusable descendants from the tab order - so the
  default produced an element that was focusable and unannounceable at once. Assert the negative
  in the suite; a comment saying the layer is unused is what shipped the bug.

- **No Jest suite may assert a chart's geometry.** jsdom implements no `ResizeObserver` and runs
  no layout, so `jest.setup.ts` supplies a stub and an invented box just to make the chart render
  at all - and Recharts does not throw without one, it renders nothing and passes every
  assertion that counts elements. Suites assert counts, fills, text and roles. Heights, widths
  and proportions are browser checks, measured with `getBoundingClientRect()` on the laid-out
  nodes.

## Storybook

Storybook keeps three sections: **Components** for `ui/`, **Screens** for the frames, **Shell**
for the app shell's own pieces. **Foundations is gone** with the token layer it documented.
`.storybook/preview.ts` imports `globals.css` and applies the font variable classes, so the
daisyUI plugin registration lands in every story automatically.

It is also the cheapest surface to verify a change on, since every component and screen renders
there with no backend and no session: `docs/agents/claude-tooling.md` covers driving it headlessly,
including the story-id index. The four `(app)` screens are the exception, being behind the session
gate.

## Formatting and dates

`frontend/src/lib/format.ts` owns display formatting, in seven parts. Money: amounts are
stored as positive magnitudes and displayed negative, and the sign is U+2212 MINUS SIGN
rather than the hyphen `Intl.NumberFormat` emits, matching the design. PET-21 added
`formatWhole()` beside it, the `docs/TODO.md` cents item's answer: the design draws every
aggregate figure whole (`"$1,240"`, the dashboard budget card's own readout) while every
per-transaction amount keeps its cents through `formatCurrency`/`formatNegative`, so a
second `Intl` instance at zero fraction digits sits beside the first rather than replacing
it. It **rounds** rather than truncating, which keeps a whole-dollar aggregate as close to
the real total as one dollar allows. Names: `initials()`
and `shortName()` derive the sidebar footer's "MK" and "Marko K." from the two stored name
fields. Both are derived and never stored (SET-2), and SET-6 requires the sidebar footer and
the Settings avatar to agree, which is why one shared function is the point rather than a
convenience. **They take one argument as of PET-72**, which collapsed the two stored name fields
into `fullName`: nothing in the app ever used them apart - the sidebar wants initials and a short
name, both derivable from one string - so the second was data collected to be thrown away. Both now
split on `/\s+/` and read the first character of the first and last piece, so a single-word name is
still initialled and a three-word one still shortens. Both take the first character with `Array.from(name)[0]` rather than
`charAt(0)`, which would split an astral-plane character into a lone surrogate. Period:
`monthOverline()` and `monthLabel()` give the page header its "October 2025" and "October",
shared because Dashboard and Transactions draw the identical overline. Both use the calendar
month and therefore ignore the profile's `monthStartDay`, which A9 says defines the period -
that value is PET-45's, and the display is correct for its default of 1. Amount input:
`formatAmountInput()`, `parseAmountInput()` and `amountCaret()` are the currency field as it is
being typed into, and they are deliberately **not** `formatCurrency`. That one goes through
`Intl`, which forces two decimals, rounds, drops a trailing separator and emits a symbol -
every one of which is wrong mid-keystroke, where a user typing `24.` would watch it become
`$24.00` under the caret. So none of the three touches `Number` on the way out, the fraction is
truncated rather than rounded, and the `$` belongs to `Input variant="currency"` instead of to
the string. `formatAmountInput` is **idempotent**, which the controlled input in
`app/setup/BudgetForm.tsx` depends on rather than merely benefits from. Calendar date:
`formatIsoDate()` turns the `YYYY-MM-DD` a transaction is stored under into the "Oct 8, 2025" the
Date field's trigger draws, and it goes through `lib/date.ts`'s `dateFromIso` rather than
`new Date(iso)` - which parses a date-only string as **UTC midnight**, so any zone behind UTC
formats it as the day before. Short calendar date: PET-29 added `formatIsoDayMonth()`, the same
date without its year - the "Oct 8" the transactions table's DATE column draws, where every row
in a period filtered to one month would otherwise repeat it. A second formatter rather than a
slice off the first, because `"Oct 8, 2025".split(',')[0]` is an assumption about a separator
that stops holding the moment the locale does.

**`lib/date.ts` is the other half of that and is deliberately not this file.** It owns the wire
form - today's date, the parts either side of a `YYYY-MM-DD` string, calendar-date arithmetic -
and touches neither `Intl` nor UTC, because a calendar date is a day rather than an instant and
must never follow a locale. That file records the two directions the mistake runs in;
`lib/calendar.ts` builds the picker's month grid on top of it.

**`lib/amountField.ts` is a third module in that family, and the line it draws is "does this touch
the DOM".** `reformatAmountInput(element)` is the currency field's keystroke handler: it writes the
formatted value onto the input, restores the caret to the position `amountCaret` computes, and
returns what the caller should store. It sits outside `lib/format.ts` because everything in that
file is strings in and strings out, which is exactly what lets its suite pin idempotence with no
document in sight. It arrived late and by the worst route - four byte-identical copies across
`app/setup/BudgetForm.tsx`, both transaction modals and the Add category modal, one past the rule of
three - so read it before changing the call order rather than reasoning from any one call site;
`frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` records what those copies cost.

All seven parts hard-code `en-US` and its separators, "Today" and "Yesterday" included. When the currency chosen during onboarding
is finally stored, the locale follows it through all of them together; `docs/TODO.md` tracks
that. The one thing that must **not** follow it is `lib/date.ts`, for the reason above.

**PET-47 answered the currency half of that and deliberately refused the locale half, so read the
paragraph above as amended twice.** Money is **not** in `lib/format.ts` any more: `lib/money.ts`
owns `formatCurrency`, `formatWhole` and `formatNegative`, and they take the profile's currency
rather than closing over `USD` at module scope. A Server Component calls
`moneyFormatters(currency)` with a currency threaded from its `page.tsx`; a Client Component calls
`useMoney()` from `(app)/PreferencesProvider.tsx`. The split exists because React context does not
cross into Server Components and twelve of the sixteen money consumers are ones - so neither half
is the "real" way. `moneyFormatters` is memoized per code, which is what makes a per-currency
formatter no dearer than the two singletons it replaced, and it takes a `string` rather than a
union of the three offered codes: the backend validates `@IsISO4217CurrencyCode()`, so a profile
can hold `JPY`, and it has to render as money rather than throw.

**The locale stays `en-US` by product decision, which is a decision rather than the deferral above.**
`EUR` renders as `€3,200.00`, never `3.200,00 €`. That is not only copy: `formatAmountInput`,
`reformatAmountInput` and `amountCaret` build the budget field's live grouping by hand with a comma
and a dot written into them, so a locale that followed the currency would desynchronise the field
being typed into from the figure rendered beside it.

**And `lib/format.ts` grew a second pair of period formatters rather than changing the first.**
`periodOverline(monthStartDay, today)` and `periodLabel(...)` name the **budgeting period**, which
is what four page headers and the Categories tab's "{period} spending" want; above a `monthStartDay`
of 1 they read "September / October 2025", because a period spanning two calendar months has no
single name and inventing one is what `docs/TODO.md`'s header-period entry was open about since
PET-19. `monthOverline` and `monthLabel` survive and are **not** deprecated: `(app)/DateField.tsx`
draws a real calendar grid and its popover header names the month that grid is _of_, where a period
label over six rows of real weeks would be nonsense. The split is calendar-month versus
budgeting-period, not old versus new. Their `today` still defaults to the frontend host's zone while
the backend resolves against `APP_TIMEZONE`, which is the pre-existing skew `docs/TODO.md` tracks
rather than a new one.

**PET-72 deleted that pair, and the deletion is the prediction above being carried out rather than a
reversal of it.** Read the paragraph as history: `periodOverline` and `periodLabel` are gone from
`lib/format.ts`, with their tests and their private month arithmetic. Their own docblock had named the
condition - "if a period ever stops being derivable from one number, this is the thing that has to
become an API field rather than the thing to extend" - and that is what happened. A period is anchored
to a paycheck now and a pay-day change **stretches** one across the gap, so a period can read
"December 2025 / January 2026", and no arithmetic over a start day and today produces that: the fact
that makes it span three month names is a `period_rules` row this app cannot see. The two functions
were not imprecise, they were unable in principle to be right.

**So a period's name is published per period and arrives beside the figures it describes.**
`lib/periods.ts` reads `GET /api/periods` for the header's select, and the categories, dashboard and
transactions reads each echo back the period they resolved - `period.label` is what four page headers
print. The zone skew the old pair carried goes with them: label and figures now come from one
resolution against `APP_TIMEZONE`, where the label used to come from the frontend host's clock. Two
consequences worth knowing. `monthOverline` and `monthLabel` are down to **one caller each**, both
`(app)/DateField.tsx`'s, which is exactly the split the paragraph above describes and the reason they
survived. And the one overline in the app that is still not the backend's is `/transactions` under
`?period=all`, where the contract publishes `period: null` because a list spanning every period has no
single label - `TransactionsScreen` prints the same "All time" the filter pill offers.

**`(app)/PreferencesProvider.tsx` lost its second field in the same change.** It carried
`monthStartDay` and a `usePeriod()` seam for one job, letting a Client Component name the period
through the pair above; nothing read the seam by the time it went. It was removed rather than left as
dead code, because a day is still enough to _compute_ a plausible label with, so the next screen to
reach for it would have got a wrong one with every gate green. The provider is currency-only now.

**The currency list is a real allowlist as of PET-72, and `lib/money.ts` reads it out of the
contract.** The paragraph above is right that `moneyFormatters` takes a `string` and must render
whatever a profile holds; what changed is what a profile _can_ hold. `@IsISO4217CurrencyCode()`
accepted `JPY` and `KWD`, whose exponents are 0 and 3, while `toCents`/`fromCents` assume 2 - so the
backend now validates against an allowlist of exponent-2 codes with `EUR` as the default, and `CurrencyCode` here
is `NonNullable<components['schemas']['UpdateProfileDto']['currency']>` rather than a hand-written
union. The picker's list `satisfies readonly { code: CurrencyCode; ... }[]`, so a code the backend
stops accepting fails `npm run build` instead of shipping an option that 400s. `docs/TODO.md` carries
what a wider list needs, which is a per-currency exponent.

**PET-85 cut that allowlist to three - `EUR`, `USD`, `GBP` - and the reason is a rendering defect
rather than a validation one, which is why it is worth a paragraph here rather than a number
change.** PET-72's list was every ISO code with an exponent of 2, twenty-nine of them, which is the
right question for a validator and the wrong one for a picker: nobody chose those codes, and
`components/BudgetField.tsx` renders them into a panel built and measured for three. Measured at
twenty-nine, that panel stood 1024px in a 757px viewport, overflowed by 294px, computed `max-height:
none` and did not scroll - and because a platform popover is in the **top layer**, positioned against
the viewport, scrolling the page could not reach the codes below the fold. So the product owner
specified the option list, which settles the tech spec's **A6** ("the option list is unknown; ship
with USD until specified"), and the panel's own constant carries the measurement.

Two things about it generalise past currencies. **The exponent rule is necessary and not sufficient
now**: a code has to clear it to be eligible and then somebody has to decide the picker offers it, so
adding one back is a product decision plus a browser check, in that order. And **nothing in this repo
can catch the defect it fixes** - every gate was green at twenty-nine, because a list's length is not
a class, a type or an assertion anybody had written. `lib/money.test.ts` pins the whole list by
equality rather than its head for exactly that reason, which is the cheapest half of the guard; the
other half is the walk.

**`lib/amount.ts` is the fourth module in that family**, and it exists because `docs/TODO.md`
predicted it and named the trigger: a third _form_ validating an amount without going through
`(app)/transactionForm.ts`. The Settings Preferences card is that form. It holds `isPositiveAmount`
and `isFilled`, the two rules that had twins in three modules; every existing export
(`isBudgetValid`, `isNameValid`, `isAmountValid`, `isMerchantValid`) keeps its own name and
delegates, so what the lift buys is one copy of each rule to fix and deliberately not one
vocabulary.

**`components/EmptyState.tsx` is the fifth direct child, and it arrived before its second
consumer rather than after.** `AccessCard` above records the usual sequence: chrome lives beside
one route until a second screen turns out to draw the identical box, then moves. This one skipped
the wait because the second consumer is already measurable in the design file - frame 07
Transactions (node `45:1044`) and frame 16 AI Insights (node `39:665`) are the same card, same
72px accent-soft circle, same heading, same 440px body, same primary button, differing only in
glyph and copy, and DSH-7 describes the same shape a third time inside the dashboard's
recent-list card. Waiting for PET-44 to prove what PET-30 could already see would have bought a
move commit and nothing else. It takes `icon`, `heading`, `body`, an optional `action` and a
`headingLevel`, defaulting to 2 because `PageHeader` owns the page's `h1`. Its box is stock
daisyUI - Figma's raw 16px radius and shadowless card stopped binding when PET-57 handed radius
and shadow to the theme - and the one deliberate deviation from the frame is `max-w-110` where
it fixes 440px: identical at the designed 1440 width, and a narrower window wraps instead of
overflowing the card's padding, the same call `AccessCard` makes about a viewport Figma never
draws.

**Relative date is the seventh part, PET-24's `formatRelativeDate(iso, today?)`.** It answers
"Today", "Yesterday", or `formatIsoDayMonth(iso)` beyond that, for the dashboard's
recent-transactions caption. `today` is a parameter with a default rather than a bare clock
read, the same shape `lib/date.ts`'s own helpers take, so "Yesterday" can be pinned in a suite
without faking a timer. It diffs `Date.UTC` of the two dates' parts rather than subtracting the
local `Date`s `dateFromIso` would hand back, because that pair is not always 24 hours apart
across a DST transition. What it cannot answer is whose "today" it is: the default reads the
frontend host's own zone, while every other figure on the page is scoped to a period the
backend resolved through `APP_TIMEZONE`, and `docs/TODO.md` records that gap beside the
per-user timezone item it already owes.

## The screens

The signed-in shell, its four routed views and the access screens outside it are documented in
`frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md`, which loads whenever you read a file under `src/app/`. Read it
before touching a route, a layout or the session gate: two of the seams there are deliberate
stubs, and the session gate's one-read shape is load-bearing.

## Environment

`BACKEND_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`) is the only variable this app reads, from
`frontend/.env.local`, and `docs/guides/configuration.md` is its single home. One rule about it
is inline in root `CLAUDE.md` because breaking it cannot be undone:

**Never give a server-only secret a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.** `BACKEND_URL` deliberately
has no prefix because it is read server-side only; a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable is inlined
into the browser bundle and is therefore public forever.

## The frontend's half of CI

The frontend's `build-storybook` step is not redundant with `build`: `tsconfig.json`
includes `.storybook/**` and the story files, so `next build` already typechecks them.
The extra step catches what typechecking cannot, such as a broken framework option or a
CSS import that no longer resolves.

**`npm run build` is the typecheck for shipped code, but it does not reach `*.test.ts(x)`.**
Root `CLAUDE.md` states the short rule; this is the exception to know. `tsconfig.json` includes
every `.tsx` in the project, so a test file with a type error is in scope on paper - and yet
`next build` passes with one, because Next typechecks the module graph its routes actually pull
in and nothing imports a test. PET-12 found this the direct way: an exclusive-union prop was
being violated in four places in one suite while `build`, `lint` and `test` were all green,
because Jest transpiles without checking types and the build never looked. **`npx tsc --noEmit`
from `frontend/` is what covers them.** Reach for it after changing a prop type, a discriminated
union or anything a test constructs by hand; CI does not.

## Not built here

Treat these as planned, not available. This list exists so you do not build on something that
is not there. One bullet per capability, ordered alphabetically by its bold lead-in; when a
capability lands, delete its whole bullet and nothing else. Why each one is deferred, where
that was a decision rather than a queue, is in `docs/TODO.md`.

- **The shell's content.** The `(app)` group, the four routes and the page header exist, every
  screen renders its designed header, and the shell is really gated and really shows the signed-in
  user's profile as of PET-52. What is missing is everything below the header on **one** of the
  four: the Settings `<main>` is empty. AI Insights was the other until PET-42-43-44, which fills
  it with frames 14, 15 and 16 off the one `state` its read carries - so read the sentence that
  named two as dated. Dashboard is no longer one of
  them as of PET-21: its `<main>` is a grid holding the real Monthly budget card, PET-22 filled
  the second, the weekly spending trend chart, PET-23 the third, the spending-by-category donut,
  PET-24 the fourth, the recent transactions card, and PET-25 the fifth and last, the AI insight
  teaser - so Dashboard is a **complete** screen too, the same word this list uses for
  Transactions below. Transactions is the exception that came before it, and as of
  PET-29 it is a **complete** screen
  rather than a partial one: the tab bar
  and its real count badge, both empty states, the filter bar and the table are all built, and the
  two slots PET-30 left are filled by `page.tsx`. They are still slots rather than direct imports,
  because both need reads the screen cannot make and Storybook has to be able to hand it
  stand-ins. The search field is a real `<input>` now and the three filter selects are real
  `<select>`s; what stays inert there is the Dashboard's month select (A8 wants a designed control
  first) and **both transactions tabs**, because "Categories" opens frame 13, which is PET-36's
  route with no `page.tsx` behind it. Every "Add transaction" button is real as of PET-31, and as
  of PET-29 a save finally shows its effect in the list rather than only in the badge - unless the
  date is backdated out of the current period, which the period select can now go and find.
  What the transactions screen still does not do is **navigate**: a row click opens nothing,
  which is PET-34's detail page, drawn and deliberately inoperable the same way the inert tabs
  are. **The kebab is live as of PET-33** and no longer belongs on that list: it opens a real
  popover menu whose "Delete" really deletes. The one thing still inert inside it is "Edit",
  which renders `menu-disabled` with `aria-disabled` because PET-32's edit modal does not
  exist - a different claim from the drawn-but-dead controls around it, since this one says so.
  **PET-32 built that modal, so nothing in the menu is inert any more**: "Edit" is a real button
  opening frame 11 prefilled from the row, and the `menu-disabled` and `aria-disabled` above are
  gone with it. A **row click** is now the only dead affordance left on the screen, which makes it
  the one a reviewer is most likely to try; it is PET-34's.
  **PET-34 built it, and the screen has no dead affordance left.** The merchant cell links to
  `/transactions/[id]`, the app's first dynamic route. Read the sentence above as history - though
  "a row click" stays literally true of the other four cells, because the link is on the merchant
  alone for the accessible-name reason `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` records.
  **PET-36 made both tabs real, so the "stays inert" list above is down to the Dashboard's month
  select alone.** `/transactions/categories` exists, both labels are `next/link`s carrying
  `aria-current`, and the badge on each tab now reads a real count - so the sentence naming "both
  transactions tabs" is history. What that ticket adds to _this_ list is smaller and of the same
  kind: its card kebab and its "Add category" header button are drawn and not yet operable,
  belonging to PET-39 and PET-37, and unlike every inert control before them they announce
  `aria-disabled` rather than staying silent. The Categories screen is otherwise complete - it
  reads its own data and renders every state the contract can hand it, the uncapped card included.
  **PET-37 made "Add category" real, so the card kebab is the last inert control on that screen**
  and PET-39 owns it. The header button opens frame 19 and really creates, which also makes the
  Categories tab the second screen in the app with a working write. Note it needed no provider,
  unlike every "Add transaction" trigger: `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` records why one button on one
  route does not want one, and it is the paragraph to read before copying the transaction shape.
  **PET-39 made the kebab real, so the sentence above naming it "the last" inert control is history -
  but the tab is not clear, and an earlier draft of this bullet said it was.** The kebab opens frame
  18's menu, whose Delete opens frame 20 and really deletes. **Three controls on that screen are
  still inert, and all three are PET-38's**: `CardBanner`'s "Set limit", which every uncapped card
  draws and therefore every account sees on `Uncategorized` at minimum; the summary card's
  "Allocate", drawn whenever budget is unassigned; and **"Edit" inside the menu**, which renders
  `menu-disabled` with `aria-disabled` because the Edit category modal does not exist. All three
  announce `aria-disabled` rather than staying silent, which is the distinction PET-33 drew and is
  why they are a different claim from the Dashboard's month select. The **fallback card offers no
  Delete at all** (AC6), which until PET-38 lands leaves that one card with a menu holding nothing
  operable.
  **PET-38 built the Edit modal, so two of those three are live and the paragraph above is dated.**
  The menu's "Edit" opens frame 21 prefilled from the card, and every uncapped card's "Set limit"
  opens the same modal focused on its budget field - which makes the Categories tab the first screen
  in the app carrying create, edit and delete for one resource. **The summary card's "Allocate" is
  the one that stays inert**, because no frame draws where it goes, so it is now the only control on
  that screen announcing `aria-disabled`. The sentence about the fallback card is history in a
  stronger sense than "resolved": that card now draws **no kebab and no banner at all**, because
  `PATCH` refuses to rename it just as `DELETE` refuses to remove it, so nothing on it is drawn that
  cannot be acted on. What that costs belongs on this list rather than only in the plan -
  **`Uncategorized` can be neither renamed nor capped from the UI**, though the API accepts a cap on
  it, and `docs/TODO.md` carries the reasoning.
  **PET-70 made "Allocate" live, so the clause above about it is dated and the screen now has no
  inert control at all.** The summary card's banner opens the Allocate budget modal, which sets every
  category's cap in one write - so `CardBanner`'s optional `onAction` is gone with it, replaced by an
  exclusive union in which an action with no handler does not typecheck. That deleted the
  `aria-disabled` treatment and its two `aria-disabled:` variants, which had exactly one caller. The
  `Uncategorized` sentence **survives unchanged and is the one to cite**: this modal excludes that row
  too, so a limitation the fallback card already had is extended rather than resolved, and the API is
  still the only way to cap it.
  **PET-46 filled the Settings `<main>`, so the "one of the four" this bullet opens on is none of
  them and every sentence above naming Settings as the empty one is dated.** All four routed views
  now render content below their header and all four fetch. What this ticket adds to _this_ list is
  narrower than the bullet it closes and is worth stating precisely, because "Settings is built" is
  the wrong summary: the frame draws **three** cards over one "Save changes", and only the first is
  here. The Profile card is real and really writes; the **Preferences card** (Currency, Monthly
  budget, Month starts on) and the **Categories summary** with its "Manage" are PET-47's and are not
  drawn at all - so unlike every other gap on this list they are not inert controls with
  `aria-disabled` on them, they are simply absent, which is the honest shape for a card whose fields
  would otherwise submit through a form that does not carry them. The Save button beneath is
  page-level rather than card-level for exactly that reason, and `settings/SettingsForm.tsx` records
  what PET-47 has to touch to join it.
  **PET-73 moved the insight cards onto the Dashboard and turned `/insights` into an assistant
  chat, which changes two sentences above and adds the route handler this list used to reserve.**
  The Dashboard's fifth card is no longer `InsightTeaserCard`: the summary banner leads the wide
  column and the two rule-based cards sit under the donut, both reading `GET /api/insights` through
  one client-side poll, so `DashboardResponseDto.insight` is deleted. `/insights` is a chat with a
  History tab beside it, and the app has a **fourth route handler** -
  `app/api/assistant/messages/route.ts` - which is what the `/api/chat` bullet this list carried was
  reserving; it is deleted rather than resolved-without, and it exists for a **third** reason
  neither of the other two covers: a cancellable long write. Two things about the pair are worth
  knowing before touching either. The banner and both cards **render nothing on a period navigated
  back to**, because insights describe the current period only. And the assistant screens are the
  **first in this app with no Figma frame at all** bar the verify-failure screen and the error
  boundary, so every string on them is invented and joins what A29 owes a designer.
  **PET-47 built the second of those three, so read "only the first is here" as dated.** The
  **Preferences card** is real and really writes: `components/BudgetField.tsx` (the monthly budget
  joined to a live `USD`/`EUR`/`GBP` picker) over `settings/MonthStartField.tsx` (28 days, capped
  and scrolling), both writing into the same `values` the Profile card does - so AC6's single PATCH
  carrying both cards falls out of the page-level form rather than being implemented. What is left
  of this bullet is the **Categories summary** with its "Manage", which is still PET-47's and still
  **not drawn at all**, for the reason the paragraph above gives: a card whose controls would submit
  through a form that does not carry them is a promise the form cannot keep, so it is absent rather
  than inert. The prediction that the second card would be "a structurally identical sibling taking
  the same four props" held exactly, with one widening - `PreferencesCard`'s `onChange` is generic
  over the field, because two of its three values are a number and an ISO code rather than typed text.
  **PET-48 built the third, and it was PET-48's rather than PET-47's** - two sentences above say
  otherwise and both are wrong rather than dated, which is worth correcting in place because a reader
  chasing the wrong ticket learns nothing. `settings/CategoriesSummaryCard.tsx` draws the count, the
  sum of the caps and the monthly budget over a secondary "Manage", from a second guarded read in
  `settings/page.tsx`. So **every card on frame 17 exists and this bullet's Settings half is
  closed**; what kept the bullet alive at that point was this card's own inert "Manage", which the
  paragraph below closes. (An earlier draft said "two inert controls" and counted the Dashboard's
  month select among them, which PET-72 had already made real.) The prediction that the third card would be another sibling of `ProfileCard` did **not**
  hold: it reads rather than writes, so it takes one `summary` object instead of the shared four
  props, touches `settingsForm.ts` nowhere, and carries no `disabled` - a save in flight freezes
  every field on the page and deliberately not this card.
  **The second inert control is that card's own "Manage", and it is a different kind from every
  other entry on this list.** The Dashboard's month select is inert because A8 wants a designed
  control first; the Categories tab's dead controls were inert because their tickets had not landed,
  and every one of them announced `aria-disabled` so a reader was told rather than left pressing.
  This one is inert **by product decision** with the destination already built: `TAB_HREFS.categories`
  exists, `/transactions/categories` is complete, and `<Button href>` is the whole change. It ships
  with no `disabled` and no `aria-disabled`, which makes it the only control in this app that looks
  operable and is not - the exact failure `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md`'s inert-control doctrine was
  written against. Recorded here rather than argued: PET-48's AC3 is amended on the ticket and
  `docs/TODO.md` carries the reasoning and the fix. Do not copy the pattern; copy the doctrine it
  departs from.
  **PET-48's follow-up made it live, so the paragraph above is history and this bullet names no
  inert control at all.** An earlier draft of this sentence said the list was "down to one, the
  Dashboard's month select" - which was wrong rather than dated, and a review caught it: PET-72
  replaced `MonthPill` with a real routing `PeriodSelect`, so that control had already been live for
  two tickets, and the root `CLAUDE.md` paragraph added in the same commit said so. Two authority
  files disagreeing about the same control is the failure this file exists to prevent, and it is
  worth leaving the correction visible rather than editing it out. "Manage" opens
  `settings/ManageCategoriesModal.tsx`, the Spendifico Design System's own
  `ui_kits/spendifico-app/ManageCategoriesModal.jsx` rebuilt on daisyUI - a scrolling list of the
  account's categories with Edit and Delete on each, over a summary island and an "Add category". So
  AC3 is **superseded** rather than amended, because the answer turned out to be neither the inert
  button nor the `<Button href>` this list kept nominating, and **this app ships no silently inert
  control again**. Keep reading the paragraph above for the doctrine; the one sentence in it that is
  now false is the one calling this the app's only such control. Two things about the modal belong on
  _this_ list rather than in the route file: it **performs no write of its own**, so the three
  category modals it opens over itself are where every write still lives, and it needed **no
  `api:sync`** for the same reason.
- **Every read a screen needs for its own data, bar the transactions list, the dashboard summary
  and the categories.** PET-52 ended the "nothing reads at all" era: `lib/session.ts` calls
  `GET /api/auth/session` and `lib/profile.ts` calls `GET /api/profile`, both lifting the session
  cookie into an `Authorization` header server-side. PET-30 added the third, `lib/transactions.ts`,
  and it is the first read a _screen_ makes for its own data - so it, rather than the two access
  reads, is the one to copy: it shows the classified-failure policy, and it shows what to do when
  the API's answer is ambiguous. PET-31 added `lib/categories.ts`, narrowed to what a picker needs.
  PET-21 added `lib/dashboard.ts`'s `readDashboard()`, the same two-branch failure policy as
  `lib/profile.ts` beside it - deliberately, since the shell already read the profile through the
  same guard a moment earlier - and no probe: the endpoint takes no filters at all, so there is no
  ambiguous-empty case for a second request to resolve. All five now go through `authorizedGet` in
  `lib/session.ts`, which is where the cookie becomes a bearer token; do not inline a sixth copy of
  that. PET-34's `lib/transactionDetail.ts` took the transaction _detail_ **and** the
  categories' month stats off this list together, in one request: `GET /api/transactions/:id`
  embeds the whole `CategoryResponseDto`, caps included, so the narrowing above is intact and
  `lib/categories.ts` was not widened. PET-42-43-44 added `lib/insights.ts`, which is the first to
  export **two** reads over one endpoint for two callers rather than two projections for two
  screens: `readInsights` returns `AuthorizedResult` and `requireInsights` redirects on top of it,
  because the Server Component must redirect a dead session and the route handler serving the
  browser's poll must never - a `redirect()` there answers a `fetch` with an HTML login page
  carrying a 200. It is also the read to copy for a **404**, which is the
  app's third failure policy - `authorizedGet` grew a `missing` arm so a deleted transaction calls
  `notFound()` instead of throwing like an unreachable backend. No other read's endpoint answers
  404, so the five above are unchanged.
  `lib/categories.ts` now holds **two** projections over one shared request: `readCategoryOptions`
  for the modal's `<select>`, and PET-29's `readCategoryLabels`, which adds `color` because a
  transaction row carries only a `categoryId` and the table joins the name and the tile colour
  onto it. A screen wanting a cap or a spend widens the right one or adds a third; do not open
  either up, since the point of the narrowing is that a cap and a month's spend never reach a
  browser bundle drawing neither. PET-64 added `icon` to the **wide** one only, for that exact
  reason: the table's tile draws the category's own glyph now, and the `<select>` draws neither
  tile nor glyph.
  **PET-64 also added the app's first unauthenticated read**, `lib/categoryTemplates.ts`, and it
  is the one that goes through none of the above. Onboarding step 2 runs before an account
  exists, so there is no cookie for `authorizedGet` to lift and no 401 to classify; it calls the
  `@Public()` `GET /api/templates/categories` directly. Its failure policy is a **third** one:
  it degrades to an empty list rather than throwing, because the chips are a selection on a step
  whose Continue is unconditional (A4), so an unreachable backend costs the user their starter
  categories rather than the whole onboarding flow. Do not copy that policy to a read that _is_
  the content of its screen - `lib/transactions.ts` is right to throw. Note that module deliberately **never redirects** - its
  route-handler caller would be handed an HTML login page with a 200 on it - so a Server
  Component using it applies the 401 policy at the call site, which
  `app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx` is the worked example of.
  **PET-37 added `lib/palette.ts` and it is the sibling of that module rather than a copy of it.**
  Both read `/api/templates/*`, and there the resemblance stops: `GET /api/templates/palette` is
  guarded, so this one goes through `authorizedGet` and classifies its failures, which is exactly the
  split `TemplatesController` argues for by name. Its policy is a **fourth**: the caller degrades to
  `null` and draws a disabled picker with a line saying why, because the palette is the contents of a
  modal rather than the contents of a screen - so neither `lib/transactions.ts`'s throw nor
  `lib/categoryTemplates.ts`'s empty list is right for it. Critically it also **does not decide
  whether the session is alive**: `transactions/categories/page.tsx` reads it beside the categories
  and lets only the categories redirect on a 401, for the reason that file records.
- **Every write except creating, editing and deleting a transaction.** PET-31 is the app's first authenticated write:
  `lib/createTransaction.ts` is a Server Action over `authorizedPost` in `lib/session.ts`, the
  write half of `authorizedGet` and the second thing to reuse rather than re-derive. Two of its
  decisions generalise to the writes still to come. It **surfaces the status on rejection** where
  the read helper collapses everything non-401 into `unavailable`, because 400, 404 and 401 need
  three different messages from a form and one of them must not say "try again". And it **does not
  parse the created row**: a 2xx whose body will not parse still means the write landed, so
  reporting failure there would have the user create a duplicate. PET-33 added the second,
  `lib/deleteTransaction.ts` over a new `authorizedDelete`, which is where to see what
  generalises: it reuses `AuthorizedWriteResult` rather than growing a shape of its own, and it
  publishes **three** reasons where the create publishes four, because a 400 there is a body the
  user can fix and a 400 here is only a malformed id. Editing and every category and profile
  write are still unbuilt.
  PET-32 added the third, `lib/updateTransaction.ts` over a new `authorizedPatch`, and it is the
  one whose classification generalises furthest: it publishes **five** reasons where the create
  publishes four and the delete three, because `PATCH /api/transactions/:id` answers 404 for a
  missing transaction **and** for a missing category and distinguishes them only in the message
  text. It splits them on whether the body it sent carried a `categoryId`, which is a fact the
  caller already has - rather than matching backend error prose, which nothing pins across the two
  apps. Its other reusable half is the **diffed body**: `(app)/transactionForm.ts`'s
  `toUpdateTransactionBody` sends only the fields that changed, `null` to clear a note, and an
  empty object when nothing did - which the caller must treat as "close without asking", because
  the endpoint rejects an empty patch. PET-42-43-44 added the fourth, `lib/generateInsights.ts`,
  and its classification is the shortest of the four for a reason worth copying: a **409 is
  reported as `ok`**. The single-run guard answers it when another tab, or a transaction the user
  just saved, already started a run - so the thing the button was pressed for is already happening,
  and the caller's next move is identical either way. A failure taxonomy is for failures the caller
  would do something different about.
  **PET-37 added the fifth, `lib/createCategory.ts`, and it is the first write outside
  transactions - so "every category write is unbuilt" is now only true of editing and deleting one.**
  Its arithmetic is the endpoint's rather than a
  simplification: **three** reasons, because `POST /api/categories` documents 400 and 401 and nothing
  else. There is no `categoryMissing`, because the body references nothing by id; no 409, because
  unlike `PATCH` and `DELETE` nothing about creating a category collides with the `Uncategorized`
  invariants; and **a duplicate name is not a conflict either**, since `categories` carries no unique
  index on `name`, `color` or `icon`. Read that as a fact about the backend rather than an oversight
  here - a uniqueness rule would arrive as a fourth arm. Its other half worth copying is that it
  **does not read the created row**: a 2xx means the category exists, so the modal returns `{ ok: true }`
  and lets `router.refresh()` bring the new card back through the same list read every other card
  comes from, rather than trusting a second source of truth.
  **PET-39 added the sixth, `lib/deleteCategory.ts`, so "every category write is unbuilt" is now true
  of editing alone.** It publishes **four** reasons, one more than either existing delete, and the
  extra arm is the whole reason it is not `lib/deleteTransaction.ts` with the noun changed: 409 is
  `fallback`, which the endpoint answers for deleting `Uncategorized`. That arm is **unreachable
  through the UI**, since the card menu omits Delete on the fallback row, and it is classified anyway
  because a hidden control is not an enforcement and "please try again" would be advice that loops
  forever - the same argument the `missing` arm already carries next door. Everything else about it is
  the transaction delete's and unchanged: an id and nothing else, a result rather than a throw, and no
  `redirect()`. Every **profile** write is still unbuilt.
  **PET-38 added the seventh, `lib/updateCategory.ts`, so "every category write is unbuilt" is now
  true of none of them** and this bullet's lead-in is down to the profile alone. It publishes
  **five** reasons, which is `updateTransaction`'s count reached by a different route: that one
  splits an ambiguous 404 in two, and this one has a 409 the create does not. `missing` is
  unambiguous here where the transaction patch has to hedge, because this body references nothing by
  id - it carries a name, a cap, a colour token, an icon name and a note - so the copy can say the
  category is gone and mean it. `fallback` is the 409, a refused rename of `Uncategorized`, and it is
  **unreachable through the UI** for a stronger reason than the delete's hidden menu item: that card
  draws no trigger into this modal at all. It is classified anyway, on the same argument its
  neighbour makes. Its diffed body is `toUpdateTransactionBody`'s with one difference worth
  carrying: **a blank cap sends `null`**, which is the only way a capped category becomes uncapped,
  where `toCreateCategoryBody` _omits_ a blank cap because `CreateCategoryDto` reads absent as "no
  cap" and takes no `null` at all.
  **PET-46 added the eighth, `lib/updateProfile.ts`, so this bullet's lead-in is exhausted: there is
  no unbuilt write left in this app.** It publishes **four** reasons, the shortest classification
  since `generateInsights`, and two things about it are worth carrying rather than re-deriving.
  **`taken` is the first 409 anywhere here that the UI can actually reach.** `updateCategory`'s
  `fallback` and `deleteCategory`'s are both classified-but-unreachable, sitting behind controls that
  are deliberately not drawn, and both carry a note saying a hidden control is not an enforcement;
  this one is the ordinary case of two accounts wanting one address, so its copy **names the cause**
  where those two hedge. The disclosure is the backend's deliberate choice - an authenticated form
  cannot tell a typo from a taken address unless it is told, where the public auth routes answer
  identical 202s to defeat enumeration - and the copy still must not imply the holder can be
  identified. And its diffed body, `settings/settingsForm.ts`'s `toUpdateProfileBody`, is
  `toUpdateCategoryBody`'s exact mirror on the one point that file flags: **it never sends `null`**,
  because `UpdateProfileDto` accepts none and every column behind it is NOT NULL, where a blank cap
  next door _must_ send `null` because that is the only way a capped category becomes uncapped. The
  two look inconsistent and are one rule stated against two DTOs; read them together or neither
  makes sense. It also publishes **no `missing` arm**, which is a decision rather than an omission:
  the endpoint carries no id at all, so there is no resource to fail to find, and an absent profile
  row is a broken invariant the backend answers 500 for.
  **PET-72 added a ninth, `lib/changeSchedule.ts`, and it is the first write with a _date_ attached to
  what it changes.** It publishes **three** reasons - `invalid`, `unauthenticated`, `failed` - and the
  interesting one is the absence: there is no conflict arm, because nothing here can collide with
  another account and sending the identical body twice converges rather than colliding (the rule
  insert is `onConflictDoNothing` and a duplicate budget row for one date resolves to the same value).
  It is also the one write whose body is **complete rather than diffed**: every field of
  `ChangeScheduleDto` is required, because a request setting a budget or a pay day is incomplete
  without saying from when. `PATCH /api/profile` could not express it and refuses both fields now, so
  a Settings save that moves either one sends this **first** and the ordinary patch second - the order
  is chosen for failure semantics, since the schedule write is the one the user was asked a question
  about.
  **PET-84 added a tenth, `lib/logOut.ts`, and it is the one that publishes no taxonomy at all.**
  Every write above names its reasons because a caller does something different per reason; this one
  has nothing to do differently and nowhere to say it, since the screen it is pressed on is being
  navigated away from. So it asks the API to revoke the session, **ignores the answer**, clears the
  `spendifico.session` cookie and redirects - and clearing the cookie on every arm is the decision
  rather than an oversight, because doing it only on a 2xx would leave a user unable to sign out of
  their own browser whenever the backend is unreachable. It is also the only write here that **must**
  be a Server Action rather than merely being one by the usual split: a Server Component's cookie jar
  is read-only and `.delete()` throws at runtime. `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` carries the rest,
  including why the action is threaded to `ui/Sidebar` as a prop.
  **And PET-72 added a sixth read, `lib/periods.ts`**, whose `readPeriods()` backs the period select on
  two screens and the AI Insights overline. Its failure policy is the throwing one rather than a
  degrading one, deliberately against `lib/categoryTemplates.ts`'s: an empty list would render a header
  naming no period over figures that are all scoped to one, which is a screen that lies rather than a
  screen with a gap. Its `?period=` half lives in **`lib/periodParams.ts`**, and that split is a build
  constraint rather than a preference - `periodHref` is called from a Client Component, and importing it
  from a module that reaches `next/headers` is something `next build` refuses.
