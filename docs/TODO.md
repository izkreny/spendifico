# TODO

Running list of work that is known, deliberately deferred, or unverified. Not a backlog of
ideas: everything here has a concrete reason to exist and enough detail to act on without
rediscovering the context.

Add an item when you defer something, and delete it when it lands. Items that grow past a
paragraph or two probably deserve their own plan in this directory.

## Deferred by the notification system (PET-77)

PET-77 built the toast region and moved every write onto it, so the HIGH IMPORTANCE entry that
stood here - "There is no notification system, and every write in the app reports itself
differently" - is closed and deleted. Five things it touched are **not** closed, and they are here
rather than in the section below because none of them was decided against: each is owed to somebody.

**The announcement is a screen-reader check that has not been run.** `(app)/ToastRegion.tsx` mounts
two `sr-only` announcers empty and writes into one per post, which is the shape this repo has now
paid for three times - but no suite can prove a live region is *announced*, only that its text
changed. It wants one pass with a real screen reader, once per kind.

**A toast raised over an open modal cannot be dismissed by its own button.** Measured in Chrome
before the component was written, and recorded in that file: a `popover` shown after a modal
`<dialog>` paints above it and is inert, because the dialog blocks everything outside its subtree.
The auto-dismiss clears it, so nothing is stuck; what is lost is the control. The only fix is
portalling the region into whichever dialog is topmost, which is fragility bought against a timer
that already works, so it was rejected rather than deferred.

**Every string in it is invented and owes A29 a sign-off**, along with the corner, the two tones and
both durations. Sixteen sentences across twelve call sites, plus the region's own "Dismiss: {message}"
control name. `Shell/Toast`'s stories are what to put in front of a designer.

**The Allocate modal's snap line is gone and nothing replaced it.** AC13 deleted it as one of the
four treatments, and the plan recommended keeping it: unlike the Settings badge it described a
**field** rather than a write, so the clamp is now silent for a screen-reader user where it is still
visible to everyone else. It cannot become a toast, because the snap fires on a keystroke. Restoring
it is a `role="status"` line and the `cappedMessage` call that still exists in `allocateForm.ts`.

**The success toast's text does not reach AA, and the review of PET-77 established that it cannot be
fixed by moving the token.**
The toast draws `text-white` on the semantic fill, after a product decision that the sentence, the
icon and the dismiss X must all be one colour - they were three colours before, because the label
took `--color-success-content` (a near-black green) while the `btn-ghost` X painted from
`--color-base-content`, which is light in dark mode and dark in light mode. Measured against the real
component in both themes, where the fills are identical: **failure is 4.829:1 and passes**, and
**success is 3.296:1 and does not**, against the 4.5:1 AA asks for 14px text.

Worth stating exactly what moved, because white made one arm better and one arm worse. The previous
pairing measured 3.44:1 for failure and 3.742:1 for success, so both failed; white fixes failure
outright and costs success about half a point. **What is left is a fill that is too light for white
text at that size**, which is `--color-success` itself - and darkening it is **not** available,
which the review measured rather than assumed. The same token is used two ways that pull in
opposite directions: as a *fill* under white text (this toast), and as *text* on `base-100` (the
soft status badges `lib/budgetStatus.ts` draws). Moving it to `#15803d` takes white-on-fill from
3.296:1 to 5.016:1 and the light theme's soft badge from 3.296:1 to 5.016:1 - and takes the **dark**
theme's soft badge from 4.977:1 down to 3.27:1, because both themes share one value. Trading a fixed
toast for a broken badge is not a fix.

So this needs a decision rather than an edit, and there are two shapes for it. **Per-theme success
values**, which the Expensa pair does not currently have (`globals.css` repeats the same six lines
in both blocks) - light gets the darker green, dark keeps the brighter one, and the toast still
fails in dark. Or **the toast stops being a filled surface**: `base-100` with a toned icon, a
border and `base-content` text, which is the shape most notification systems use and the only one
where both kinds pass in both themes. The second contradicts the product owner's instruction that
the toast text be white, so it is theirs to take. Note the treatment this replaced had the same
defect and hid it: `badge badge-success` was measured against the *card* behind it rather than as
text on its own fill.

**"Response stopped." is a failure toast, and a stop is not a failure.** With the `info` kind
dropped there are two, and a deliberate cancel fits neither: green claims something worked, red says
something went wrong, and the assertive announcement interrupts a user who just pressed Stop and
knows. It is the one place the two-kind scheme is visibly short a kind.

## Deferred cleanup
- **Fix oversized CLAUDE.md files:** `backend/CLAUDE.md` (>700 lines) and `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` (>1000 lines) need to be restructured and moved into feature subdirectories according to conventions.
- **Fix JSDOM Version Mismatch:** `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `jest.setup.ts` comments mention `jsdom 26.1.0`, while `frontend/package.json` depends on `jest-environment-jsdom: ^30.4.1`. Update the comments to reflect the actual installed version.
- **`btn-primary`'s label fails WCAG AA in the dark theme, app-wide:** measured composited in headless Chromium at **3.90:1**, against the 4.5:1 floor for normal text (light is fine at 5.35:1). `--color-primary` is `#6963ee` and `--color-primary-content` `#edecfd` in `expensa-dark`. **It is every primary button in the app, not one screen**: PET-78 found it on the Dashboard's assistant link and proved it pre-existing by measuring the untouched "Add transaction" header button, which reads identically - the fill is opaque, so nothing behind it contributes. Not fixed there deliberately, because the fix moves a theme token and that triggers `frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s palette guard: both colour explainers have to be re-opened and every measured figure in them re-taken, since a theme change voids all of them. The cheap end is darkening `--color-primary-content` toward the near-black cast the other `-content` tokens use rather than touching `--color-primary`, which the whole category palette resolves against. Recorded rather than ticketed by the product owner's decision.

---

## Deferred by design

These were decided against deliberately. Reasons are recorded so the decision is not
relitigated by accident.

### The Dashboard summary banner no longer says which period it describes

PET-78 deleted the banner's uppercase eyebrow at the product owner's request, because the
Dashboard stated the period three times: the page header's overline, the period select beside it,
and "AUGUST 2026 SUMMARY" as the banner's own first line.

What that gives up is precise and worth stating rather than discovering. The eyebrow was the only
place the card named the period its analysis covers, and **a set can outlive its own period**:
`GET /api/insights` serves the latest **ready** set whatever today is, so an account that writes
nothing after a period rolls over sees last period's analysis on this period's Dashboard.
`isCurrentPeriod` does not cover it - that flag asks which period the *screen* is showing, not when
the set was generated - so the banner is silently one period stale rather than absent.

Restoring the eyebrow is the wrong fix, because the defect is **staleness rather than a missing
name**: a card labelled "July 2026 summary" on the August Dashboard is honest and still useless. The
fix is a "generated {date}" line, or suppressing the banner when the set's own period is not the
current one - which needs `GET /api/insights` to publish a period, which it does not. Filed here
rather than as a bug because no account reaches it without a full period of inactivity, and the
first write of the new period clears it.

### A run that failed before the Dashboard loaded is invisible, and the poll can only see its own

A review of PR #92 found PET-78's Regenerate condition missing a fourth dead end: a run that fails
**after** a previously successful set. `insights.service.ts` skips a `failed` row and serves the
newest `ready` one, so `GET /api/insights` answers `state: 'ready'` and the card looks perfectly
healthy while the prose on it predates the write that triggered the run - with, before the fix, no
control on screen able to start another.

What shipped closes the half the frontend can see. `InsightPoll` compares `generatedAt` across a
settle: the column is written at exactly one place backend-side, inside the transition to `ready`, so
an unmoved value means the run produced nothing, and `runFailed` puts Regenerate back. That covers
every run **this mount watched** - the button pressed, and the run that fires behind a save, since
the modal's `router.refresh()` hands the provider a `generating` set and the poll follows it.

The half it cannot cover is a run that failed while the user was on another screen, or before this
mount existed. Loading the Dashboard fresh onto a stale set answers `ready` with no signal anywhere
in the response, and no arithmetic over that response recovers one. Closing it is **one nullable
field on `InsightSetResponseDto`** - the instant of the newest `failed` row when it is newer than the
newest `ready` set, or a bare boolean - derived in `getSet` beside the two queries already there, and
it is deliberately not in PET-78: that ticket is a UI/UX fixup round with no backend change in it, and
this one wants a DTO change, an `api:sync` and an e2e case of its own.

Note it is the **same shape** as the entry above, which wants `GET /api/insights` to publish a
period. Both are "the card cannot tell the user how current this set is", and whichever ticket takes
one should look at taking both, because they are one query away from each other.

### The verify page's inherited constraints, now that it exists

PET-52 built the frontend half: `app/auth/verify/route.ts` spends the emailed link,
`spendifico.session` carries the result, and `lib/session.ts` plus `lib/profile.ts` are the
app's first two reads. Four things that ticket could not close, and one it deliberately did
not.

**The live token reaches the frontend's own access log.** The backend moved verify's token
into a POST body precisely so a live credential never hit *its* logs, and the handler puts it
straight into Next's request log and anything upstream - the same class of leak PET-12 removed
when it replaced `/check-email?email=`. Not fixable here: the URL is chosen by
`backend/src/mail/login-link.template.ts` and the token has to arrive somehow. What bounds it
is that the token is single-use and is consumed by the very request that logged it, so the
line is dead before anyone reads it, and the handler always answers a redirect so it leaves
the address bar on the first paint. This is the same accepted exposure as browser history and
the `Referer` header, one door further along.

**The route path is declared in two apps and nothing checks they agree.**
`login-link.template.ts` builds `/auth/verify` and `app/auth/verify/route.ts` answers it.
Change either and every login email in production points at a 404, with no gate failing and no
test noticing. `routes.test.ts` pins the frontend's half against the literal string, which is
as far as one repo half can reach. Same shape as the `LOGIN_LINK_TTL_M` coupling below.

**Verify's per-IP throttler now sees one address for the whole deployment.** The handler POSTs
from the frontend server, so every verify in the application lands in one bucket - 15 per 15
minutes on the deployed values. The third route to inherit this, after register and
login-link, and the reason the failure screen has a `busy` reason at all. The fix is the same
two-sided one described under "The auth throttler is in-memory", and neither half works alone.

**A stale session cookie survives a manual revocation.** Nothing on the read path can clear
it: the gate runs in a Server Component, where the cookie jar is read-only and `.delete()`
throws `ReadonlyRequestCookiesError` at runtime with nothing in the types to warn you. This amends the stub's own step 4, which said "clear the cookie and redirect", and
`layout.test.tsx` pins that no delete is attempted so nobody "completes" the spec and breaks
the shell. It costs almost nothing, because the cookie's `Max-Age` is derived from the
session's own `expiresAt`, so an *expired* session's cookie is gone from the browser before
the backend would reject it. Only a hand-written tombstone reaches the state, and only until
the cookie expires.

**The shell makes one backend request per render, and briefly made two - which had a loop in
it.** Review of the PR caught it before merge; recorded because the shape is easy to
reintroduce. With a session gate *and* a profile read, the layout treated any absent profile as
"not signed in" and redirected to `/login` - which sends a signed-in visitor to `/dashboard`,
whose layout bounced straight back. A live session whose profile read failed for any reason (the
broken-invariant 500, a timeout, a restart mid-render) therefore made **the whole app
unreachable, including the login screen**, until the backend settled.

Two things fixed it, and both are worth keeping. `GET /api/profile` is guarded, so one call
answers "is this a live session" on its way to answering "whose" - there is no second read to
disagree with the first, and the layout carries no branch of its own. And `lib/profile.ts`
separates **"not signed in" from "could not ask"**: only a 401 or a missing cookie redirects,
while an unavailable backend throws so Next's error boundary renders something a reload retries.
`profile.test.ts` pins that an unavailable backend never redirects.

**The rule to carry forward: never answer "the backend did not respond" with a redirect into the
access flow.** Any route that both gates and reads has the same trap available to it.

The residue is that the design draws no error screen anywhere (A19, A29), so what a reader sees
when the throw fires is Next's own. A custom `error.tsx` is a designer conversation rather than
a gap PET-52 could close.

**Closed 2026-08-06 by PET-21, and the designer conversation is the part that is left.** Four
`lib/` modules ended their failure policy on the sentence "so Next's error boundary renders
something a reload retries" while no `error.tsx` existed anywhere under `frontend/src/app` - so
what the sentence described was Next's built-in "Application error: a server-side exception has
occurred", with no chrome and nothing to click. PET-21 is what forced it rather than what broke
it: `/dashboard` is where `/auth/verify` lands after a login, so it is the first read whose
failure a user can meet before seeing the app at all. `frontend/src/app/error.tsx` is now that
boundary, one at the root so a `requireProfile()` throw in the shell's own layout lands there
too, and `ErrorScreen.tsx` beside it holds the screen. Its two strings and its retry are ours,
so they join the A29 group with A15's no-results copy and A38's verify-failure copy: real until
a designer looks at them, not placeholders. What is still owed is the designer's answer, plus
the question this deferred rather than settled - whether a failure inside the signed-in shell
should keep the sidebar, which is a second boundary at `(app)/error.tsx` and a second copy of
this copy.

**The wait behind the verify click was measured on 2026-08-05, and the blank page stands.**
This was the open question A33/A19 left: verify is one blocking POST with no loading state
designed, so the number decided whether a waiting state had to go to the designer. Measured
in cloud mode against Turso (group `decode-pet`, `aws-eu-west-1`), with a throwaway central
database so nothing touched the real directory:

- **First verification, which provisions:** 2.10s and 1.83s across two accounts. That covers
  creating the Turso database, minting its token, persisting the pointer, opening and
  migrating it, inserting the profile and seeding the categories.
- **Returning verification:** 4.1ms, 4.3ms and 4.8ms across three links for one account.
  Effectively instant, as the design assumed.
- `POST /api/auth/register` answers in 14ms, because it floats the token issue and the mail
  send rather than awaiting them.

**So no designed waiting state is needed.** Roughly two seconds of blank tab after clicking a
link in an email is the normalized OAuth and SSO redirect experience, and it happens once per
account, ever. A streamed "Signing you in..." shell remains technically cheap but is an
in-page loading state, which is exactly what the design deliberately lacks - so it stays a
design conversation rather than a gap.

Two honesty notes on the number. It is the **backend POST alone**, timed from the same
machine as the server, so it excludes the browser's own navigation, the frontend route
handler's overhead and the redirected Dashboard render; the figure a user experiences is
larger by whatever the network adds. And it was taken against a group that had already been
used that session - `TursoPlatformService` warns in its own comment that creating a database
is slower on a cold group, so treat 2s as a floor for the provisioning case rather than a
worst case.

### `/check-email` is the one access route with no session gate

PET-52 gated `/setup` and `/login`, which `docs/TODO.md` had asked it to answer in the same
breath, and deliberately left this one alone. Its entire premise is that no session exists
yet - it is the screen a user sits on while waiting for mail - so a gate would add a round
trip to the pre-session wait to defend against a state nobody reaches by accident. The way to
reach it signed in is to verify in a second tab and come back, at which point the screen says
something true and harmless.

Recorded so the asymmetry reads as a decision rather than an oversight. If it ever needs
answering differently, it is the same three-line `hasSession()` branch the other three carry.

### Handing a browser a token to sync with directly

`TursoPlatformService` documents but does not implement `mintUserDbToken(dbName, expiry)`,
the short-expiry variant of `mintDbToken` needed to let a client sync against its own Turso
database instead of going through this backend. Nothing needs it today - the access flow is
finished and never wanted it, because every read is served with the user's server-side
token - so it stays a documented signature until a client actually syncs.

### Sliding session expiry, as an explicit extension endpoint

Sessions fix their expiry at `SESSION_TTL_D` (30 days) and a unit test pins "validate
performs no UPDATE", so the whoami path stays one indexed read. Sliding
expiry inside `validate()` was rejected deliberately: it turns every authenticated read
into a central-database write (sync and `updated_at` churn, contention on the in-process
transaction chain), and it silently desyncs from the frontend's future cookie, whose
Max-Age would still die at the original 30 days however far the row was extended.

If monthly re-login ever becomes a real complaint, the design to reach for is an explicit
`POST /api/auth/session/extend` behind `SessionGuard`, called by the frontend on its own
policy - it already knows `expiresAt` from `GET /api/auth/session` - and answering with
the new `expiresAt` so the caller re-sets the cookie's Max-Age in the same round trip;
the two lifetimes then stay in sync by construction. The backend still enforces pacing
server-side with one conditional `UPDATE ... RETURNING` (extend only when, say, under 25
of the 30 days remain, so a hammering client produces zero-row updates rather than
churn), plus an absolute cap keyed on the existing `created_at` (never past creation +
90 days) so an extendable stolen token stays bounded. Rotating the token on extend is
the stricter variant if that ever matters. Purely additive: same table, same token, same
guard, no schema change.

### Insights are generated by rules, not an LLM

`RuleBasedInsightGenerator` produces the summary and its cards from deterministic detectors over
the user's own data - over-cap and month-over-month - filling templated copy. Rules were chosen
over an LLM deliberately: no API key, no per-run cost, no non-determinism, and specs that assert
AC-exact strings, while the epic's "AI" stays honest branding of what the cards say. The seam is
real rather than aspirational: `InsightGenerator` is bound through the `INSIGHT_GENERATOR` token in
`InsightsModule`, so a future `LlmInsightGenerator` is a one-line provider swap with storage, the
read, the `POST /api/insights/generate` trigger and the frontend untouched. The card wording is the
part most likely to be tuned first.

It was four detectors until PET-42-43-44, and the two that went are worth knowing about rather than
simply gone. **End-of-month projection** was cut as duplicated content, not as broken: the summary
banner's headline already picks between "over budget", "trending over budget" and "on track" from
the same projection, so the card restated the hero element beside it. The maths stays and feeds
that headline. **Recurring-merchant detection** was cut as unreliable by nature, which is the one
worth reading before anybody reimplements it. It never needed a merchant list - it grouped whatever
merchant strings the user's own transactions contained and demanded three or more distinct months,
exactly one charge per month, and every monthly total within a tolerance of the mean. PET-62 had
already added the second and third conditions after the first version reported a supermarket, a
petrol station and a café as subscriptions. The remaining problem is not a threshold: a monthly
travel pass at a steady price is mathematically identical to Netflix, irregular manual logging
disqualifies a genuine subscription, and usage-based billing that varies disqualifies it too.
**Recurrence may simply not be knowable from transaction data alone**, so a reimplementation needs
better evidence than month counting - a merchant taxonomy, a user confirmation step, or bank
metadata this app does not have.

### The rest of the data model

`users`, `login_links` and `sessions` (central) and `profile`, `categories`,
`transactions` and the insights tables (per user) exist. PET-41 added `insight_sets` and
`insights` under `backend/drizzle/user/` with the read; PET-40 added rule-based generation and
PET-56 hardened its lifecycle, so the insights feature is complete on the backend. So are
`categories` (list, create, update, delete, per-category month stats and the allocation summary)
and `transactions` (the three writes from PET-27 plus the list and the detail read).

Everything period-scoped stays computed on read: no table carries a month column or a stored
aggregate, on purpose, so nothing can go stale and a backdated row re-buckets for free.
`PeriodService` resolves every period and nothing else computes one. **What PET-72 changed is the
clause that used to sit here about a changed `monthStartDay` re-bucketing history "for free"** - that
was the mechanism working and the desirability backwards, since re-bucketing all history is exactly
the rewriting an effective-dated history exists to prevent. The budget, the caps and the pay schedule
are three append-only histories now, resolved at the period's start; `backend/CLAUDE.md` and
`backend/src/database/CLAUDE.md` own the shape between them. Both indexes the transaction reads want (`date`, `category_id`) ship in the first
migration. The one deliberate exception is insight content, which is stored as rendered prose
because a persisted generation is a snapshot rather than a derived view - see `backend/CLAUDE.md`.

Starter category colors were read per chip from the design's variable bindings in Figma frame
03 (node 43:705); PET-57 then remapped each colour word onto its nearest daisyUI theme colour
(`frontend/src/components/ui/categoryColour.ts`), so the words stay the stored identity while
the rendered hue follows the active theme - the mapping is nearest-match and lossy on purpose,
and which words collide is `frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s to state. Two open design
questions remain, both for the designer rather than for code:

- **The palette has eight colors for ten chips**, so Subscriptions reuses Transport's blue
  and Other reuses Bills' orange. Colour therefore cannot identify a category on its own,
  which constrains any later legend, chart or filter that wants to key on it.
- **A7's conflict sits on the same seam.** The starter set includes Bills and
  Subscriptions, which never reappear, while later screens show Health and Other - and the
  duplicated colors are exactly on those chips. All ten are seeded until it is resolved.

Both questions stopped being theoretical when PET-10 shipped Setup step 2: all ten chips are
now on screen, so the two repeated colours are visible side by side and Bills and Subscriptions
are offered to every new account. Neither is a blocker, and neither should be answered in code.

**PET-64 answered both, and the two paragraphs above are dated to before it.** The chip list is
admin-managed data in central rather than a ten-name constant, and the twelve seeded templates
retire Bills, Subscriptions, Housing and Shopping outright - so A7's seam is gone with the names
that sat on it. The palette is the seventeen daisyUI semantic tokens, so no two categories are
forced onto one colour; three seeded pairs are still deliberately close in OKLab, which is a
legibility call rather than a shortage, and `frontend/src/components/ui/categoryColour.ts` names
all three with their measured ΔE. What still holds unchanged is the constraint the first bullet
draws: **colour does not identify a category on its own**, so the per-category icon is the
identity channel and every mark that carries colour is `aria-hidden` beside real text.

### The transaction detail fields no form captures (A20)

The transaction detail mock (DET-8) shows **time, payment method, status and account**
alongside the fields that are really stored. No form anywhere in the design captures any of
them, and no screen lets a user set one, so PET-27 gave them no columns and
`CreateTransactionDto` no properties.

The consequence is deliberate and worth knowing before building the reads: because
`forbidNonWhitelisted` is on, sending one of those keys is a **400**, not a silently dropped
field. That is the safer direction - a dropped field would let a frontend believe it saved
something - but it does mean a client that codes from the detail mock rather than from the
generated types will get a rejection.

**PET-28 and PET-34 must answer them as empty or defaulted rather than hunting for a
column.** Two ways out when the designer is available: either the mock's values are
illustrative and the detail view drops them, or a form has to capture them and they earn
columns in a later migration. Until then A20 stands, and nothing should infer a payment
method from anything.

### The Figma file still says Expensa

The product became **Spendifico** on 2026-08-02 and PET-51 finished the rename: the login
email, the OpenAPI document title, the docs, every internal identifier, and the per-user
database prefix, on top of the wordmark and `<title>` PET-18 had already taken. The only
places left that say Expensa are the ones naming this divergence, plus `docs/plans/` and
`docs/reviews/`, which are dated records. The plan is
`docs/plans/2026-08-02_PET-51_spendifico-rename.md`.

The design file is the one holdout: it still draws the old logo and wordmark, and swapping
the asset is the designer's call. Until it happens, `ui/Sidebar.tsx` renders "Spendifico"
against the design on purpose, `Sidebar.test.tsx` pins that so it cannot be half-reverted,
and `02-tech-spec-personal-expense-tracker.md` records the departure beside its **Source:**
note.

**One constraint the rename leaves behind.** `USER_DB_NAME_PREFIX` was renamed while it was
still free, verified against live Turso: no per-user database existed and no `users` row
named one. **That window is now shut**: PET-52 shipped the verify page, so a real account can
verify and the first per-user database can exist. `userDbName(id)`
derives the name and `users.db_name` persists it, so a second rename would strand every
existing account silently - `getUserDb` creates a fresh empty file instead of opening the
synced one, and `deleteUserDb`, which derives the name from the id on purpose because its
caller may have no row to read, targets a database that is not there. Doing it then means
`db_name` first becoming the source of truth wherever a name is needed, with the constant
applying to new users only, which costs `deleteUserDb` that no-row compensation path. That is
a real change to `UserDatabaseService` rather than a rename, and infrastructure naming no user
ever sees does not need to follow the brand a second time.

### A15's no-results state is amended, and its copy is ours until a variant is designed

A15 said: no search-or-filter no-results state is designed, so show frame 07's "No transactions
yet" message without hiding the controls until a designed variant exists. PET-30 kept the second
half and **amended the first**, which also amends its own AC5.

The reason is that the placeholder is not merely thin, it is wrong. Frame 07's body reads "Log
your first expense and it'll show up here, sorted and categorised automatically." Shown to
somebody with a hundred transactions whose search matched nothing, that reports the account as
empty when it is full, and the button it offers does not address what went wrong. A15 was a
default for an undesigned state rather than a decision about this one, so the two strings changed:
the no-results state reads **"No matching transactions"** over **"Try a different search term,
category or period."** Everything else - the card, the glyph, the "Add transaction" button - is
identical, and the controls stay on screen exactly as A15 asked.

**What is owed.** A designed no-results variant, at which point these two strings are replaced
rather than kept. Until then they join the list under A29's item above: copy that ships, was not
read off a frame, and needs a designer's sign-off. `Screens/07 Transactions — No results` is the
quickest thing to put in front of them, next to the `Empty` story it should be diffed against.
The designed state keeps Figma's UK "categorised" untouched, which is A30's copy pass and not
this.

### The transactions filter bar's two amount sort labels are ours (PET-67)

A16 records that Figma never draws the sort dropdown open, so "Newest first" is the only option in
that list read off a frame. PET-29 added "Oldest first" as the amendment that made AC5 implementable
at all, and PET-67 added two more when the contract grew an amount sort: **"Highest amount"** and
**"Lowest amount"**, chosen by the product owner.

They join the A29 group rather than needing an argument of their own - copy that ships, was not read
off a frame, and needs a designer's sign-off. `Screens/06 Transactions — List`'s `Filtered` story is
the quickest thing to put them in front of, since it opens with an amount sort active.

**What is also worth a designer's answer there**, and is a layout question rather than copy: that same
story is the only surface on which PET-67's swap can be reviewed. The period control moved into the
header and the search field into the filter bar, at the product owner's direction and against TRN-1
and node `26:137`, so the frame and the app now disagree about the arrangement of that screen on
purpose. Nothing is undesigned about the individual controls; what has never been drawn is the two of
them in these positions.

### The designed empty state on /transactions now offers no search field (PET-67)

A consequence of the swap above rather than a decision taken on its own. TRN-3 removes the filter bar
in the `empty` state, and the search field is inside that bar now, so an account with nothing logged
is offered nothing to search.

It is defensible on its own terms - there is nothing to search - and it is safe in the way that
matters: `lib/transactions.ts` decides `empty` from an account-wide `period=all` probe, so no
keystroke can reach that state and no term can be stranded mid-typing. What is not settled is whether
a designer wants the field drawn and disabled there instead, which is the sort of thing frame 07 would
have answered if it drew the bar at all. `Screens/07 Transactions — Empty` is the story.

### Telling an empty account from an empty filter costs a second request

`GET /api/transactions` returns `total` **after** filters and no account-wide count beside it -
PET-28 considered the second count and dropped it, because no frame draws two numbers. Combined
with `period` defaulting to `current`, that leaves a `total` of 0 meaning any of three things: the
account is empty, a filter matched nothing, or the account's transactions are all in an earlier
month.

The third is the one that forces a decision rather than a preference. Treating it as the first
renders "Log your first expense" over a real history and, because TRN-3 removes the filter bar in
that state, leaves no control on screen that could change the period to go and find it - the user
is told they have no data and given no way to disagree. Inferring the state from whether a filter
looks active gets exactly that case wrong, because that case has no active filter.

So `lib/transactions.ts` reads a second time when the first read returns zero: `period=all`, no
other filter, and only then. Every page load with data on it still costs one request, and the
extra round trip is spent only on the state that has nothing to render. **What would remove it is
a count the API does not publish** - an unfiltered total beside the filtered one, which is a
backend change reversing a recorded PET-28 decision, so it wants a real reason rather than tidiness.
One reason may arrive on its own: if the period select ever offers "All time" (A16 leaves its
options unknown), a caller already asking for `period=all` pays one redundant request in the empty
case, and `readTransactionsView` should short-circuit rather than probe.

**Amended 2026-08-05 by PET-29: that reason arrived, and the short-circuit is in.** The period
select offers "All time", so `period=all` with no search and no category is now one click away,
and its first read already *is* the probe - answering zero to it means the account is empty and
there is nothing left to ask. `readTransactionsView` returns `empty` directly in that one case.
The condition is "these filters already are the probe" rather than "the period is all": an
all-time read narrowed by a search or a category still leaves the two states apart, so it still
probes. The second request is otherwise unchanged, and so is the argument for eventually
replacing it with a count the API publishes.

**One cost of the search field is worth naming here**, because it multiplies against this. A
search matching nothing costs two requests rather than one, so a navigation per keystroke would
be two round trips per keystroke - which is why the 300ms debounce in
`app/(app)/transactions/TransactionSearch.tsx` is load-bearing rather than a nicety.

### The filter bar's pending state is a browser check, not a jsdom one

`app/(app)/transactions/FilterNavigation.tsx` dims the table and sets `aria-busy` while a filter
change is in flight, and the moment it turns true cannot be asserted under Jest. A transition
stays pending only while something inside it suspends; in the running app that is
`router.replace` suspending on the RSC payload, and a mocked router resolves immediately, so the
callback completes synchronously and `isPending` is false again before an assertion can run.

Rewriting `navigate` into an async transition purely so a test could observe it would be
contorting the component to suit the harness, which is the call `(app)/Modal.tsx` already makes
about Escape and its focus trap. So the suite pins everything either side - that the region is
mounted around the table, that it is silent at rest, that the controls reach the provider at all -
and the busy state itself is eyeballed.

The near miss is worth recording, because it is what the region exists to prevent: an earlier
version of this ticket gave `TransactionsTable` a `pending` prop that **no caller could pass**,
and its tests set the prop by hand, so they were green against a feature wired to nothing. If a
future change breaks the wiring again, the assertion that catches it is the one in
`TransactionsScreen.test.tsx` that the table sits inside the region, not anything about the class.

### The row menu's open, close and Escape are browser checks, and jsdom is not being polyfilled

`app/(app)/transactions/TransactionRowMenu.tsx` is daisyUI's popover dropdown, so AC1's "clicking
elsewhere or pressing Escape closes it" is light dismiss and the Escape default action rather
than anything this repo wrote. **jsdom 26.1.0 implements none of the Popover API** - verified
directly: `showPopover` is `undefined` and `popoverTargetElement` is not on
`HTMLButtonElement` - so none of that is observable under Jest.

`jest.setup.ts` polyfills `<dialog>` and deliberately does **not** polyfill this, which is the
decision worth recording rather than the gap. Faking `showPopover`, light dismiss and Escape
would turn AC1 into a test of those few lines: it would pass just as happily with `popover`
deleted from the markup, which is exactly the failure the dialog polyfill's own comment refuses
for Escape. The consequence is that under Jest the menu never hides, so both items are always
queryable - and no assertion in `TransactionRowMenu.test.tsx` should be read as proving the menu
opened. What that suite pins is the wiring the browser needs: the trigger's accessible name, the
`popovertarget`-to-`id` pairing, the `anchor-name`-to-`position-anchor` pairing, that two rows
get two ids, and what Delete hands the provider.

The check that is not automated anywhere is therefore opening `Screens/06 Transactions — List`
and using it. The day jsdom ships the real API this evaporates on its own, the way the dialog
polyfill's `typeof` guard is written to.

### The row menu is unanchored in Firefox, and daisyUI's own fallback is what ships

daisyUI positions `.dropdown[popover]` with CSS anchor positioning (`position-area` against a
`position-anchor`), which Firefox does not support. Its stylesheet carries an
`@supports not (position-area: bottom)` branch that centres the popover and draws a dimmed
`::backdrop` instead, so the menu opens and works - it simply appears in the middle of the
viewport rather than under the kebab that opened it.

Accepted rather than fixed. The alternatives are hand-rolling positioning (a resize and scroll
listener plus a collision strategy, which is the kind of code the popover was chosen to avoid) or
pulling in a positioning library for one engine and one control. Both cost more than the
degradation, and the fallback is a coherent design rather than a broken one. Worth revisiting
when Firefox ships anchor positioning, at which point the fix is deleting nothing.

**Firefox has shipped it, so the condition this entry set for itself is met.** PET-39's browser
walk measured Firefox **153** directly rather than reading a support table:
`CSS.supports('position-area', 'bottom')`, `CSS.supports('anchor-name', '--a')` and
`'showPopover' in HTMLElement.prototype` are all **true**. So daisyUI's
`@supports not (position-area: bottom)` branch no longer matches there, both this menu and the
category card menu anchor normally, and "the fix is deleting nothing" turned out to be literally
right: nothing was ever written for it and nothing has to be removed.

What is owed is only the deletion of this entry, and it is left standing for one release rather
than removed on the spot, because the measurement was taken on one machine's Firefox and the
degradation is still real for anyone on an older build. Delete it once the supported-version floor
is clearly past 153. **Do not read this as the two costs being gone**: jsdom still implements none
of the Popover API, so the "under Jest the menu is permanently open" half of every popover suite is
unchanged and is a separate note.

### The icon set is lucide's now, and three marks are near-misses the designer has not seen

PET-33 added `lucide-react` and migrated all thirteen hand-traced glyphs onto it, so there is one
icon idiom and no traced SVG left in `frontend/src` outside the tests, `app/icon.svg` and the
wordmark. What did **not** come with it is a designer's sign-off, and three specifics are worth
naming rather than leaving to be re-discovered by whoever next opens the design file.

**The sidebar changed weight.** Its four glyphs were the only *filled* marks in the app; lucide is
uniformly stroke-based, so the navigation reads a shade lighter than Figma draws it. Taken
deliberately - four solid glyphs beside an already-stroked hamburger, chevron and magnifier was
the larger inconsistency - but it is a visible deviation from the frames rather than a swap, and
it is the one an eye lands on first.

**Two of the four are approximations.** `AlignLeft` (Transactions) draws four ragged lines where
the trace drew three, and `SlidersHorizontal` (Settings) draws three rows where the trace drew
two. Both keep the property that made the original readable - the short last line is what stops
Transactions reading as a second hamburger, and the offset knobs are what say "adjustable" rather
than "toggled" - so neither is wrong, but neither is the drawn mark either. `Sparkle` is the one
to leave alone: it is exactly the single four-pointed concave star the design uses for AI, and
"correcting" it to `Sparkles` would add two smaller stars the frames do not have.

The cheap resolution is a designer confirming the set against frames 04 to 17, which folds into
whatever pass A29 eventually gets for the undesigned states. The expensive one, if the filled
sidebar turns out to be load-bearing, is a per-icon `fill` override, which fights the library.

**This item replaces three that the migration answered**, and one fact from them is worth keeping
rather than losing with the entry: the design file draws the category tile's placeholder shopping
bag **twice**, and differently - node 15:13 puts the handle left of centre over a bag spanning
3..17, node 27:149 centres it. That was actionable while the code traced one of them and would
have had to pick when a second surface drew the tile (the dashboard's recent list, DSH-7, is
next). It is not any more: both surfaces get lucide's `ShoppingBag`, so the discrepancy is now
the design file's alone. Worth mentioning in the same conversation as the sign-off above, and
worth nobody re-tracing either node to "match Figma".

### The transactions page re-reads the categories on every filter change

`app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx` runs `readTransactionsView` and `readCategoryLabels` in
`Promise.all`, and both re-run on every navigation - so each debounced keystroke, each category
change and each sort change fetches a category list that cannot have changed. With the probe
above, a search matching nothing costs **three** backend requests where one would do.

Deliberate for now rather than overlooked. The obvious fix is caching the category read, and the
invalidation story is the part that makes it a decision rather than a tidy-up: a category created
in the Add transaction modal has to appear in the filter select, and the modal already re-reads
on every open with `cache: 'no-store'` for exactly that reason. Ten categories is also a cheap
query against a per-user SQLite database, so the win is small today.

What would change the calculus is the account-wide count discussed above landing, or a user with
enough categories that the join stops being trivial. Whoever picks it up should look at the two
reads together rather than only this one.

### The tab badges: `/transactions` reads a whole list for a number, and the assistant no longer does

Placed here rather than at the end of the section because it is the entry above continued, and the
cross-reference is the whole content of it.

`app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx` numbers its **Categories** tab by calling `readCategoryLabels()`
and taking the length of what comes back - a full category list, with every name, colour and icon,
fetched on a route that draws none of them, so that one integer can be rendered in a pill. PET-76 hit
the identical problem giving the assistant's History tab a badge, and answered it the other way:
`GET /api/assistant/sessions/count` returns `{ total }` and nothing else, so the Chat route pays one
small round trip instead of transferring a list it discards. `AssistantSessionsResponseDto` and that
endpoint share one predicate backend-side, which is what keeps the two published totals from
disagreeing.

**The question this entry exists to ask is whether Transactions should follow.** Three things to weigh
before assuming yes:

- The categories read there is **not** wasted the way the assistant's would have been. That page also
  needs the list for its filter select, so the badge is riding on a request that has another caller -
  which is precisely why the assistant case is clearer-cut than this one.
- The sibling badge on that bar reads `total` off the transactions response, already the right shape,
  and `docs/TODO.md`'s account-wide-count entry above is about a *different* missing number.
- A count endpoint per resource is a pattern with a cost of its own: two endpoints publishing one
  fact, which only stays honest while they share a predicate. The assistant pair does; a third and
  fourth would each need the same discipline.

So the likely answer is "not for Transactions, and yes for the next tab bar whose count has no other
caller" - but it is a real decision rather than an oversight, and it should be made with both call
sites in front of whoever makes it. The product owner asked for it to be written down here when the
assistant badge landed.

### Money and dates hard-code `en-US`, and three modules move together or not at all

**What is left of the "header period ignores the profile's month start day" entry, which PET-47
answered and PET-72 replaced outright.** That fix composed a period's name from `monthStartDay` and
today; PET-72 deleted `periodOverline` and `periodLabel` with the derivation itself, because a period
anchored to a paycheck can be stretched across two calendar months and no arithmetic over a start day
names one. The label is a field on four responses now - which is exactly what the old entry's own
closing note said was owed - so nothing about the period's *name* is deferred any more.

The locale is. `lib/format.ts`'s date formatters hard-code `en-US`, and so does the currency field
being typed into: `formatAmountInput` writes the comma group separator and the dot decimal by hand,
`amountCaret` counts positions against them, and `reformatAmountInput` restores a caret computed from
both. **They move together or not at all**, which is why this is one entry rather than three. The
visible symptom today is that a European-formatted paste (`2.000,50`) reads as `2.00` in the budget
field - pinned in `format.test.ts` rather than fixed, because fixing it means knowing the user's
locale, and no user timezone or locale is stored (see the server-timezone entry below, which wants the
same missing profile data).

**Note money's locale is a decision rather than this deferral.** `EUR` renders as `€3,200.00`, never
`3.200,00 €`, by product call - `frontend/CLAUDE.md` records it. What is deferred is the *date* half
and the hand-built separators above, not the currency symbol's placement.

Note the tests are not exposed to the timezone half of this. `format.test.ts` builds every fixture
with the local-time `Date` constructor rather than an ISO string, and says why: `new Date('2025-10-08')`
parses as UTC, so west of Greenwich a date on the 1st formats as the month before.

### The design shows whole dollars and `formatCurrency` always emits cents

`formatCurrency(1240)` returns `"$1,240.00"`, pinned in `frontend/src/lib/format.test.ts`,
while frame 01's sample card and frame 04's real budget card both draw `"$1,240"`. So the
shared formatter cannot produce the string the design asks for.

Welcome sidesteps it: its figures are permanent marketing copy, so `SAMPLE_BUDGET` holds
literal strings.
**The dashboard's budget card cannot sidestep it**, because its numbers are real. That ticket
needs either a no-cents variant beside `formatCurrency` or a designer answer on whether the
app shows cents at all - and the answer probably differs by context, since a transaction of
$24.50 clearly needs them while a $2,000 budget clearly does not. Recorded now because it is
cheap to note and annoying to rediscover mid-ticket.

**PET-9 did not resolve this**, and it is worth being clear why, because it added a function
that looks like it might have. `formatAmountInput` is the budget field as it is being typed
into: it truncates rather than rounds, keeps a trailing `.` so a half-typed value survives, and
emits no symbol at all. So the two still disagree - the field shows `2,000` while
`formatCurrency(2000)` is `$2,000.00` - and the dashboard's budget card still needs the answer
above.

**Answered 2026-08-06 by PET-21, and this is the resolution rather than a designer sign-off.**
The epic's own mocks answer the "does the app show cents at all" question, and the split is
exactly the contextual one this item predicted: aggregates are whole dollars (`$1,240 of $2,000`,
`$760 left`, `$54` avg/day on the budget card; the same pattern across PET-22 to PET-26's
mocks) and per-transaction amounts keep their cents (`−$24.00` on the transactions table, which
already went through `formatNegative`). So `lib/format.ts` gained `formatWhole()` beside
`formatCurrency()` rather than replacing it - a second `Intl` instance at zero fraction digits
that **rounds**, which keeps a whole-dollar aggregate as close to the real total as one dollar
allows, where truncating would bias every figure on the dashboard downwards. That does mean a
summary can sit a dollar off the sum of the cents a user adds up by hand, which is inherent in
drawing whole dollars at all and is the design's call rather than ours. The *currency* half of
this item is untouched and still owed: all of `format.ts` hard-codes `en-US` until onboarding's
chosen currency is stored, `formatWhole` included.

### The budget card's status chip ships two tones, and a third is a real designer question

Node 22:55 draws only "On track", and PET-21's ticket says other tones follow the Status
palette used elsewhere - which authorises inventing them, not how many to invent. Two are
forced by the contract: `DashboardResponseDto.remaining` is documented as able to go negative,
with the note that "overspending is a state the frontend needs the magnitude to draw". So
`BudgetCard` ships exactly two - under budget is "On track" in `badge-soft badge-success`, over
budget is "Over budget" in `badge-soft badge-error` - and that is the whole set.

**What is owed.** A middle "getting close" tone would need a threshold - 80% of the budget? 90%?
pace-relative to `daysLeft`? - that nobody has chosen, and picking one here would ship a number
the design never states as if it were designed. Joins the running set of copy and state this
app ships without a frame behind it, alongside A15's no-results string and A29's inline error
copy: real until a designer looks at it, not a placeholder.

**Answered 2026-08-11 on PET-74, by adoption rather than invention.** The threshold this item
refused to pick already existed elsewhere in the product: PET-35 bands every category at 75% of
its cap, on cents, and the category cards follow that `status` off the API - so the product call
is that the whole budget bands the same way, rather than a summary bar sitting green beside a
wall of amber category bars describing the same money. `frontend/src/lib/budgetStatus.ts`
mirrors the backend's `statusFor` and is shared by `BudgetCard` and the Categories tab's
`SpendingSummaryCard`, so the two screens cannot answer the one question differently; both chips
now carry four tones (`On track` / `Near` / `Full` / `Over budget`) and both bars follow their
chip. What this does *not* answer is the designer's half: 75% is the backend's number, adopted
for consistency, and a designed threshold - or a pace-relative one - would replace it in one
place.

### The trend chart draws a week that has not happened yet, and no frame says how

`weeklyBucketsOf` tiles the whole budgeting period regardless of where today falls, so most of
the time the chart holds buckets for weeks still to come. Node 22:55 draws a completed month and
answers this nowhere, and until PET-22's review nothing distinguished them: an unstarted week and
AC5's genuinely spend-free week were the same `$0` label over the same minimum bar. `TrendCard`
now mutes everything after the current week and names both states with an `sr-only` line -
"Current week" and "Upcoming week" - so two more strings and one more visual state join what A29
owes a designer, alongside A15's no-results copy and `BudgetCard`'s badge tones above (two when
this was written; four since PET-74, and the sign-off owed is unchanged).

**What is owed is a decision, not a fix.** Muting is one answer; omitting the future buckets
entirely is another, and it is the one a designer might well prefer, since a chart that grows
bars as the period runs reads as progress where a chart that fades them reads as absence. The
card has `highlightIndex` in hand either way, so switching costs a line. It ships muted because
that keeps the axis stable as weeks land, which is the property the running total in the card
above it already has.

**The Recharts retrofit changed how those two strings are delivered and added a third surface to
sign off.** The per-column `sr-only` spans became one `sr-only` list, since every figure on the
chart is SVG text now and the plot is `aria-hidden`; each week reads as one sentence naming its
caption, its date range, its amount and its state. And the chart gained a **hover tooltip**
carrying the bucket's date range and amount, which amends AC4's "no tooltip" and is recorded on
the ticket. So what A29 owes here is now three things rather than two: the muted state, the two
state names, and the tooltip's existence and content. The tooltip is the one worth a designer's
attention soonest, because it is the only place the app admits that a **short final bucket** is
short - `weeklyBucketsOf` ends the last bucket at the period end, so a two or three day stub is
captioned "Week 5" beside four full weeks, and the range in the tooltip is the sole correction.
A pointer-only fact would have been the wrong home for that, which is why the list carries it
too.

### VERY IMPORTANT: every transaction must resolve to a live category, and the write path still cannot guarantee it

**The rule.** A transaction always belongs to exactly one category, and the default is
**Uncategorized**. Nothing in the product has a concept of uncategorized-as-in-absent: the
fallback category is a real row (`is_fallback = 1`, colour `#98A0AE`) seeded into every user
database whether or not the user picked anything, and `DELETE /api/categories/:id` moves a deleted
category's transactions into it before tombstoning. Treat "which category is this in" as a
question that always has an answer.

**`NOT NULL` is not what enforces this, and assuming it does is the trap.**
`transactions.category_id` is indeed `NOT NULL`, so no transaction can lack an id. But
`backend/src/database/user/schema.ts` is **FK-less by design** - its own comment says "No
`.references()`: the schema is FK-less throughout, so reads already have to tolerate a dangling
id" - and categories are **soft-deleted**, with every read filtering `isNull(deletedAt)`. So the
column guarantees a *value*, never a *resolvable* one, and the failure mode is not a null
category but a category tombstoned out from under a live transaction.

**What already enforces it.** Two of three layers:

- Writes check the category is live before storing (`assertCategoryExists`).
- Deletes reassign to the fallback before tombstoning.
- Reads fold anything that slipped through into the fallback, added with PET-23:
  `CategoriesService.withSpend` sums in-window transactions matching no live category and adds
  them to the Uncategorized row. **This is what lets the dashboard promise that the category
  spends sum to the period total and the percentages sum to 100**, which PET-23's donut requires
  in order to draw a ring that always closes.

**What still does not, and this is the open work.** The check and the write are separate
statements, so a create or update can pass `assertCategoryExists`, have a concurrent
`DELETE /api/categories/:id` sweep its reassignment past, and then land its write with the id that
just died. Rare - two overlapping requests on one user's own database, sub-second window - but
permanent once it happens, because nothing repairs the row afterwards. The read-time fold hides
the consequence; it does not restore the invariant in storage.

**The obvious fix is forbidden here, which is why this is still open.** Wrapping check and write
in `db.transaction()` is what both `categories.service.ts` and `transactions.service.ts` refuse at
the top of the file: the embedded driver refuses overlapping transactions rather than queueing
them, so a second transactional call site on a user database turns a rare correctness bug into a
common availability one. The fix that respects that constraint is a **conditional single
statement**: an `INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM categories WHERE id = ? AND
deleted_at IS NULL)` that inserts zero rows when the category died, with the same `EXISTS` added
to the update's `WHERE`. Atomic, no transaction, no overlap. It needs a decision about error
semantics first, since a zero-row update then means either "no such transaction" or "the category
just died" and the endpoint currently promises a 404 always means the transaction id.

**PET-70 shipped the first instance of that shape, so this is a pattern to copy rather than an idea
to evaluate.** `CategoriesService.setCaps` puts the condition in the statement's own `WHERE` - a
`(select count(*) ...) = n` subquery alongside the id set and the tombstone filter, with
`RETURNING id` reporting what landed - and it holds the property this entry wants: atomic, no
transaction, no overlap. It also **made the error-semantics decision** this paragraph says is needed
first, for its own case: all-or-nothing, a 404 naming the whole payload, and a message stating that
nothing was written so the identical body is safe to retry. That maps onto the transaction fix
directly, since the ambiguity here is the same shape - the difference is only that this endpoint has
an existing 404 promise to keep, so the new condition needs its own status or its own wording rather
than folding into that one. One trap worth carrying over: `setCaps` had to build its `CASE` arms and
its `IN` list from one array, because a row matched by the `WHERE` with no arm falls through and is
written NULL. Any conditional statement whose SET is per-row inherits that hazard.

A repair pass for rows already orphaned belongs with it: one
`UPDATE transactions SET category_id = <fallback> WHERE category_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM
categories WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)`, idempotent and almost always zero rows.

**The review of PET-23 found what the unrepaired row costs a client, so the repair has a second
reason to happen and a note to delete when it does.** Because the fold attributes on read and
changes nothing in storage, the two endpoints disagree about exactly one row: `GET /categories`
can report Uncategorized with a `transactionCount` that
`GET /transactions?categoryId=<fallback id>` will not return, since that filter matches the id
still stored on the row. Counted, and not enumerable. It is documented on
`CategoryResponseDto.spent` and `.transactionCount` rather than left for a client to discover,
and the `UPDATE` above is what makes both descriptions deletable. Until then, do not build a
"see these transactions" link off that count for the fallback row.

**One stale claim to fix while in there.** Both service files say `LoginTokenService.issue()` is
the app's only transactional call site. `insights.service.ts` added a second one on a user
database, so the sentence is no longer true.

### The dashboard's chart states need seeded data, and the seed script does not exist yet

Two of PET-22's acceptance criteria have never been checked against a running backend, only
against Storybook fixtures built by hand to match what the API is *believed* to send. That is a
weaker check than it looks: the fixture and the component were written by the same person from
the same reading of the contract, so a misreading of `weeklyBucketsOf` would appear in both and
cancel out. The pair is **AC5** (a spend-free week still appears with a zero value rather than
being dropped) and the **short final bucket** (`weeklyBucketsOf` ends its last bucket at the
period end, so a period that is not a clean multiple of seven draws a two or three day stub
captioned like a full week).

**What blocks them is data, not effort.** Both need an account sitting at a specific point in a
specific period:

- AC5 needs a **past** week with no spending, which means at least two weeks elapsed with a gap
  between two spending weeks. A future-dated transaction does not substitute, because a week
  after today renders in the muted "upcoming" tone and is a different state.
- The short final bucket needs today to fall in a period whose length leaves a remainder. This
  one is occasionally free: at the default `monthStartDay: 1`, any 31-day month tiles into five
  buckets whose last is three days.
- Reaching either deliberately means setting `monthStartDay`, and **no screen can**: the Settings
  preferences card is PET-47 and is not built, so today it is a `PATCH /api/profile` by hand or a
  direct write to the user database. PET-46 built the Settings page's form and its Profile card but
  deliberately not that card, so this stays true and its blocker narrowed from "Settings does not
  exist" to "PET-47".

**Deferred until there is a dummy-content script, and it should be built on that script rather
than beside it.** Seeding a believable account is wanted for far more than this - every empty
state has a populated twin nobody can see without typing transactions in one at a time, and the
same is true of PET-23's donut (a category shortfall, which the backend documents as reachable
through a dangling category, has no manual route to it at all). So the thing to write is one
script that can put an account into a named scenario, and these two checks become two of its
scenarios rather than a fixture of their own. Writing a bespoke harness for the trend chart now
would be the throwaway version of it.

When that lands, the verification is a headless Chromium walk of `/dashboard` like the one
PET-22's retrofit already uses on Storybook, plus a run in a visible browser so a human can
confirm the same states. The walk's assertions are already written and are the ones to reuse: the
zero week keeps its caption over a floored bar and is drawn in the ordinary tone rather than the
muted one, and the short bucket's tooltip reads its true range, which for a bucket ending
`2026-09-01` is `Aug 29 – Aug 31` and never `Sep 1`, since `endDate` is exclusive.

### The onboarding draft is per tab, and four things follow from that

PET-9 holds the draft in sessionStorage under one key, read through `useSyncExternalStore`.
Four consequences, none of them bugs, all of them things a reader would otherwise discover:

A **new tab** at `/setup` starts empty, because sessionStorage is per tab. That is the point -
a shared machine must not offer the next person a half-finished registration carrying somebody
else's name and email - but it does mean "open in new tab" loses the draft.

A **hard refresh keeps it**, which is more than PET-9 AC5 asks for and is a side effect rather
than a designed behaviour. Nothing depends on it.

The write is **best effort**: a `QuotaExceededError` or Safari's historical private-mode throw
is swallowed, and the in-memory cache is updated before the write is attempted, so the field
still shows what was typed. Persisting degrades; the form does not.

**A successful register clears it, and nothing else does.** Back must not, because every step's
AC5 forbids it, and no reset control is designed anywhere - so an *abandoned* onboarding still
shows stale values in that tab until it closes. PET-11 took the one natural moment: `clearDraft`
runs after the 202, which is when the values have a real account behind them.

That leaves one accepted consequence, recorded here because it looks like a bug and is a
decision. **The browser's own Back button from screen 24 reaches an empty Register.** PET-11
deleted screen 24's own "Back" control for this reason - amending A37, VER-3 and PET-12's AC6 -
but deleting a control does not delete the history entry, and the draft is gone by then. Accepted
on three grounds: the account exists and the login link is sent, so nothing is lost; the form's
own validation turns an accidental empty re-submit into three inline messages rather than a bad
request; and a deliberate re-submit of the same address is explicitly safe, because the backend
sends a fresh link instead of duplicating (REG-6, A35). Both alternatives are worse - keeping the
draft alive defeats the clearing, and suppressing the history entry means `router.replace` on the
way to screen 24, which would also swallow the legitimate Back from Register to step 2.

### The budget field's caret has two rough edges, and jsdom cannot see either

Both are pinned by tests in `frontend/src/lib/format.test.ts` so they are documented rather
than rediscovered, and both need a deliberate keystroke sequence.

Typing a leading `0` in front of an existing number drops the zero correctly but advances the
caret past the first digit. And erasing the leading digit of `2,000` yields `0` rather than
`000`, because the leading-zero collapse fires on the cleaned string - numerically right, and
startling enough to read as "one backspace cleared the field". Backspacing a separator is the
mildest of the three: the formatter reinstates it, so only the caret moves. The fix for all
three is a separator-aware `keydown` handler, which was out of PET-9's scope.

Sharper than any of them, for whoever changes this code: **the caret's final position is not
observable under jsdom.** React saves and restores a selection around its own controlled-input
commit, and `user-event` keeps its own cursor bookkeeping on top, so an assertion on
`selectionStart` passes identically with the restore deleted from `BudgetForm` - which an
earlier version of that test did. The suite therefore asserts that `setSelectionRange` was
called with the computed offset, and the visible behaviour is a Storybook or manual check. A
real browser test (Playwright, or Storybook's own test runner) is what would close this
properly, and nothing in the repo runs one yet.

**PET-31 made that missing browser test matter more, and one of the gaps it named turned out to be
a bug.** `(app)/Modal.tsx` is built on the native `<dialog>`, and jsdom 26.1.0 implements almost
none of it - `HTMLDialogElement.prototype` carries exactly `constructor` and `open`. So
`jest.setup.ts` fakes `showModal()` and `close()` and **deliberately stops there**, leaving two
things unassertable: **Escape** (in a browser the UA fires `cancel`, whose default action closes the
dialog) and the **focus trap**. Faking Escape was the obvious next step and is the wrong one: AC7's
"Escape closes the modal" would then be a test of fifteen lines of polyfill, passing just as
happily with the real behaviour deleted.

The amount field's caret is the third, since the modal reuses `BudgetForm`'s handler verbatim. All
three are checked by hand against `Shell/Modal`'s `FromTrigger` story and
`Screens/09 Add transaction`, in both Chrome and Firefox, because every one of them is the
browser's behaviour rather than ours. One real browser test would close the whole set at once,
which is the strongest argument yet for adding the runner.


### A29's inline error pattern is now live rather than illustrative

The inline error treatment (an error-state control plus one line of copy beneath, owned by
`ui/Field` until PET-57 folded it into `ui/Input` and `ui/Select` over `ui/FieldShell`) shipped with PET-17 but
nothing rendered it in a real flow - only `Input.stories.tsx`'s `WithError` story. PET-9's
budget validation is the first live use, with the string `Enter an amount greater than 0.`
taken verbatim from that story rather than invented.

That raises the priority of the designer sign-off A29 already owed. The pattern is now what
users see, and every remaining form ticket (PET-11, PET-12, Settings, the transaction forms)
will copy it. PET-10 did not: A4 enforces no minimum selection, so step 2 has nothing to
validate and deliberately ships no error state at all.

**PET-11 raised it again, with five strings and a second shape.** Step 3 is the first screen with
more than one thing to validate, so it needed copy the design file does not contain: `Enter your
first name.`, `Enter your last name.`, `Enter your email address.`, `Enter a valid email
address.`, and for a failed request `We couldn't create your account. Please try again.` All five
follow the shape of the one live message rather than inventing a voice, but none was read off a
frame. The `Screens/22 Register` story's `WithMessages` case renders all of them at once, which is
the quickest thing to put in front of the designer.

The second shape is the one that needs an actual decision rather than a sign-off: **a form-level
message, which the field components have no concept of.** A field's inline line is per-field and
deliberately carries no `role="alert"`; a failed request belongs to no field and arrives after a
network round trip with nothing else on screen changing, so PET-11's line sits above the footer
row in the same `text-error` treatment *with* `role="alert"`. If a second form ever needs one,
that is the moment it belongs in `ui/` rather than in a screen.

Two things the same screen does not validate, both deliberate. `@MaxLength(100)` on the two names
is **not** mirrored client-side: no `maxlength` is drawn in the frame, so a longer name gets a 400
rendered as the generic form-level message rather than an inline one. And `isEmailValid` is looser
than the DTO's `@IsEmail()`, which is validator.js, so a handful of addresses pass here and come
back a 400 the same way - `lib/email.test.ts` pins `marko@email.com.` as the example. Closing either
gap means shipping a validation dependency for one field, or copying validator.js's expression
into the frontend where it would rot silently.

**PET-12 raised it a third time, with five more strings and one that is a decision rather than a
sign-off.** Screen 23's failure line is `We couldn't send your login link. Please try again.`,
shaped like PET-11's. Screen 24's four are all A36's, which says outright that no cooldown, counter
or confirmation is designed for "Resend link": `A new link is on its way.` after a success,
`We couldn't send a new link. Please try again.` after a failure,
`Too many requests. Please wait a few minutes and try again.` for a 429, and
`This page has been open too long to resend.` when the address cookie has expired. The
`Screens/24 Check your email` stories reach all four by clicking the button - the last one through
its own `ResendAfterExpiry` story, because fifteen minutes of waiting is not something a
click-through finds.

Two decisions inside that worth a designer's eye rather than a rubber stamp. **A resend now confirms
itself**, which A36 says nothing is designed for - and the alternative is worse rather than
cheaper: with no confirmation a click has no observable effect at all, so a user cannot tell whether
it worked and clicks until the backend's five-per-address limiter answers 429, which without the
third string would also render as nothing. **And there is deliberately no cooldown**, which A36 does
mention. The backend's per-address throttler is the real limit and a client-side timer would be a
second, weaker authority that a reload defeats, so the 429 message replaces it. If the designer
wants a visible cooldown, it belongs on top of that message rather than instead of it.

**One accepted a11y consequence of the expiry state.** When the resend reports an expired address,
the button the user just pressed is replaced by the "Log in again" link, so keyboard focus falls back
to the document rather than following to the new control. The message carries `role="alert"` partly
for that reason - it announces what replaced the button - but a user tabbing from where they were will
re-enter the card from the top. Moving focus deliberately needs a focus-management pattern this repo
does not have yet, and inventing one for a single control is the wrong first mover; the day a second
screen swaps a control in place, it belongs in `ui/`.

**PET-52 raised it a fourth time, with eight more strings and a whole screen behind them.** A38 says
outright that nothing is designed for opening the link - "no success landing, expired-link,
already-used-link, or wrong-device screen" - only that these should be handled "with plain messages
and a way to request a new link". So `/auth/verify/failed` is the one screen in the app with no Figma
frame at all, and its four headings and four body lines are ours:

- `This link no longer works` / `Login links can only be used once and expire after a short time.
  Send yourself a new one.` for a 401 or a 400.
- `A newer link was sent` / `This link was replaced when a newer one was requested. Open the most
  recent email to sign in.` for the 409.
- `Too many attempts` / `Please wait a few minutes and then request a new link.` for a 429.
- `We couldn't sign you in` / `Something went wrong on our end. Please try again.` for a fault, an
  unreachable backend, or a reason the URL claims that does not exist.

Four rather than one generic apology, because three of the four would be misleading if collapsed: a
replaced link wants the newest email, a throttled one wants waiting, and a fault leaves the link
itself still live. The `Screens/Verify link failed` stories reach all four, and they carry **no frame
number** because there is no frame - which also makes opening them the only review this screen can
get. The card and both controls are screen 24's, so what actually needs the designer's eye is the
copy rather than the layout.

**PET-30 raised it a fifth time, with two strings, and this pair is different from the twelve
above.** Every earlier addition filled a state the design simply never drew. These two *replace* a
string the design does draw: A15 instructed the no-results state to reuse frame 07's "No
transactions yet" copy, and PET-30 shipped **"No matching transactions"** over **"Try a different
search term, category or period."** instead. So the sign-off asked for here is not "is this
acceptable copy for a gap" but "was overriding your instruction right" - the argument being that
frame 07's body tells a user with a full history to log their first expense. The reasoning is under
A15's own item above, and `Screens/07 Transactions — No results` sits beside the `Empty` story it
should be compared against. If the answer is no, reverting is two strings in
`TransactionsEmpty.tsx` and the assertions naming them.

**PET-31 raised it a sixth time, with nine strings, and it is the first form with more than one way
to fail.** Four are field messages - `Choose a category.`, `Choose a date.`, `Enter a merchant.`,
and `Enter an amount greater than 0.` reused verbatim from the budget field. Four are the
form-level line with `role="alert"`, in the treatment `components/FormError.tsx` owns since the
PET-57 review extracted it - `ui/Field` held it when this item was written - one per way the write
can be refused: `We couldn't add this transaction. Please check the values and try again.` for a 400,
`That category no longer exists. Pick another one.` for a 404, `Your session has expired. Log in
again to save this.` for a 401, and `We couldn't add this transaction. Please try again.` for
everything else. The ninth covers the categories read failing:
`We couldn't load your categories. Please close this and try again.`

Two things in that set are decisions rather than sign-offs. **The amount message covers both AC3's
"missing" and AC4's "zero or negative"**, because it states the rule rather than the symptom and is
therefore true of an empty field and a typed `0` alike - the ticket carries an amendment saying so,
so QA does not read AC4 as requiring a second string. And **four failure lines rather than one
apology**, because collapsing them would make two actively wrong: a 400 told to "try again" loops
forever on a body the DTO will always reject, and a 404 has an obvious next move that a generic line
hides. `Screens/09 Add transaction`'s `WithMessages` story renders the four field messages at once,
and `CategoriesUnavailable` shows the ninth.

**PET-32 raised it a seventh time, with four new strings over six reused ones.** Its modal holds ten
messages: **six are frame 09's verbatim** - the four field messages, the 401 and the categories-read
line - and **four are new**. Each field message states a rule rather than an operation, so "Enter an
amount greater than 0." is as true of an edit as of a create, and a second wording of one rule a
modal apart would be the defect rather than the consistency; the 401 and the categories line say
nothing about which operation was attempted. The four new ones are:
`We couldn't save this transaction. Please check the values and try again.` for a 400,
`This transaction no longer exists. Close this and refresh the list.` for a 404 on a patch that did
not touch the category, `This transaction or that category no longer exists. Close this and try
again.` for a 404 on one that did, and
`We couldn't save this transaction. Please try again.` for everything else.

The decision inside that set rather than the sign-off is **two lines for one status**. The backend
answers 404 for a missing transaction and for a missing category and distinguishes them only in its
own message text, so the frontend narrows it from the body it sent: with no `categoryId` in the patch
the row is the only thing that can be missing, and that is the overwhelmingly common case, since
nothing in this frontend can delete a category yet while deleting a *transaction* is a button on
every row. One combined line was the alternative and would tell somebody whose row was deleted in
another tab that "this transaction or that category" is missing, on the path users actually reach.
`Screens/11 Edit transaction`'s `WithMessages` story renders the field messages over a **prefilled**
form, which is the only way a user reaches validation in an edit, and its `Saving` and
`CategoriesUnavailable` stories cover the two undesigned states around them.

**PET-34 raised it an eighth time, with five new strings and no reused ones**, because a read
screen shares no failure vocabulary with a form. They are `{over} over {cap}` on the budget bar for
a category past its cap, `Nothing else in {category} yet.` where the recent list would be, and the
not-found boundary's three: `That transaction is gone`, `It may have been deleted. Everything else
is still on your transactions list.` and `Back to transactions`.

Two things about that set are worth the designer's eye more than the wording is. **The largest
undesigned surface here is the one with no string at all**: an uncapped category renders no chip,
no bar and no remaining line, and the deliberate choice was absence rather than an explanation of
absence - no "No cap set" placeholder. That is the *common* case, since caps are optional and the
preselected fallback ships without one, so the frame draws the rarer state and
`Screens/08 Transaction detail`'s `Uncapped` story is the one to review. And **the not-found copy
claims a cause it cannot verify** - "It may have been deleted" - which is hedged deliberately: the
backend answers one 404 for an unknown id, another user's id and a tombstoned row alike, so
anything more definite would be invented. `OverBudget`, `WithoutANote` and `NoRecent` cover the
other three undrawn states on the same story module.

### The Add transaction modal's date picker has no Figma counterpart at all

ADD-7 draws the Date field as a **closed select** showing "Oct 8, 2025", and assumption A14 says to
"use a standard date picker and confirm the pattern with the designer". Frame 09 never opens it, and
no frame anywhere in the file contains a calendar - so PET-31 built one and every part of it inside
the trigger is invented.

What the design does fix, and what PET-31 matched exactly: the resting field is `ui/Select`'s box,
padding and chevron, so it is pixel-identical to the Category select above it. What is ours: a 280px
popover; a **six-row** grid, fixed so paging cannot change the popover's height under the user's
cursor; **Monday-first** single-letter column headings; the three day-cell states (selected, today,
default), none of which the file colours; the two month chevrons, which are `ui/Select`'s own leaf
rotated a quarter turn; and the whole keyboard model - arrows by day and week, PageUp and PageDown
by month with the day clamped rather than rolled, Enter to pick.

Two consequences worth the designer's attention rather than just a nod. There is **no year
control**: paging December forward reaches January, which makes the two chevrons sufficient but
makes a date two years back twenty-four clicks away. And the trigger is a `<button>` rather than a
`<select>`, which is what makes the popover possible at all and is the reason
`(app)/DateField.tsx` carries three ARIA decisions the two real fields beside it do not need.

**The week starts on Monday, which is a product decision and not the app's locale.** Every other
formatter in the frontend is pinned to `en-US`, where the week starts on Sunday - so this one
deliberately disagrees with its neighbours, on the grounds that a spending week reads better ending
at the weekend. Two things follow that are easy to get wrong later. `leadingBlanks` in
`lib/calendar.ts` is the **only** place `getDay()`'s Sunday-first numbering is converted, and its
suite pins that the two schemes coincide on no day of the week at all - so a stray `getDay()` used
as a column index is always wrong rather than occasionally right. And the grid's worst case moved
with the first day: it is now a 31-day month starting on **Sunday** (37 cells) where it used to be
one starting on Saturday. If the locale work `lib/format.ts` defers ever arrives, this is a
deliberate exception to it rather than an oversight to sweep up.

**The popover is `position: fixed` and that is not cosmetic.** A modal `<dialog>` gets
`overflow: auto` and a `max-height` from the user agent, so an `absolute` popover anchored to the
field is inside that scroll box: opening it grew the dialog's `scrollHeight` from 532 to 663, put a
scrollbar down the side of the modal, and clipped 131px of the calendar - all measured in Chrome.
`fixed` escapes both, because the dialog sets no `transform`, `filter` or `contain` and so
establishes no containing block, while the popover stays a DOM child of the dialog and therefore
still paints inside its top layer. The cost is that the coordinates are computed on open rather
than declared, which brings two small limits with it: the flip-above decision reads a
`POPOVER_HEIGHT` constant that is only correct because `monthMatrix` fixes the grid at six rows,
and a window resize **closes** the popover rather than repositioning it. Both are cheap to revisit
if a second popover ever appears; a shared positioning helper is what that would want.

### A created transaction can legitimately fail to appear, and two smaller edges around it

`GET /api/transactions` defaults to `period=current`, so a transaction dated into an earlier month
is created successfully and then shows up in neither the list nor the count badge. To the user the
modal closes and nothing happens, which reads exactly like a failed save. Backdating is not an edge
case the backend tolerates but a documented feature of it - `CreateTransactionDto` says so, and the
date is stored verbatim precisely to support it.

PET-31 deliberately neither fixed nor prevented this. All three candidate fixes are owned
elsewhere: switching the list's period to the new transaction's month is filter state **PET-29**
owns; a confirmation naming the month ("Added to September") is new copy plus a state A19 and A29
design nothing for; and bounding the date field to the current period contradicts the DTO. The near
neighbour is worth knowing too - a **future** date inside the current month does appear, and one in
the next month does not.

**Amended 2026-08-06 by PET-32: an edit can do it too, and the same three fixes are still the
candidates.** Changing a transaction's date into another month makes the row leave a
`period=current` list exactly as a backdated create never joins it, and the modal closes on a
save that looks like it did nothing. Verified rather than prevented, for the reasons below plus one
of its own: the date field is prefilled with the row's own date, so the user who moves it out of the
period did so deliberately, which is a weaker case for a confirmation than the create's and the same
case for not bounding the field.

**Amended 2026-08-05 by PET-29: there is a way to go and find it now, and nothing automatic.**
The period select offers "Last month" and "All time", so a backdated transaction is two clicks
from being visible instead of being unreachable - which is the part that made this a defect
rather than a quirk. What PET-29 did **not** do is switch the period for you after a save. That
would mean the modal reaching into the list's filter state to move it somewhere the user did not
ask to go, and the honest fix is still the one A19 and A29 owe copy for: a confirmation naming
the month it landed in. The count badge remains the only immediate feedback, and it still does
not tick for a backdated row.

Two smaller edges from the same ticket. A successful save from an **empty state** destroys the
button that opened the modal, because the empty card is replaced by the (currently blank) table -
so the browser's focus restore has nowhere to return to and focus falls back to the document. That
is the same class of problem as screen 24's expiry swap above, and the same answer applies: it wants
a focus-management pattern this repo does not have, and a single control is the wrong first mover.
And **background scroll behind an open modal is unhandled**: `showModal()` does not lock it, three
of four `<main>` elements are still empty so there is nothing to scroll yet, and the fix if it ever
matters is an `overflow-hidden` toggle plus `scrollbar-gutter: stable` - both undesigned, and
neither observable in jsdom.

**The first of those two is live now.** PET-29 filled the table, so a save from the empty state
replaces the card with real rows rather than with a blank slot - which means the focus restore
lands on a document that has visibly changed under it. Still the same fix and still nobody's
single control to invent.

**PET-33 puts the same gap on a path users take far more often, which is the argument for finally
fixing it.** Deleting a row destroys the kebab that opened the confirmation dialog, so `Modal`'s
`isConnected` guard finds nothing connected and focus lands on `<body>`. Saving from the empty
state happens once per account; deleting a transaction happens whenever somebody tidies their
log, and every one of them leaves the next Tab starting from the top of the page. It is still the
same fix - a focus-management pattern this repo does not have - and it is still wrong to invent
one for a single control, but the frequency has changed enough that whoever builds PET-34's
detail page should look at it: deleting from there navigates, which sidesteps the problem for
that entry point and leaves the row menu as the only one with it.

**A code review then found this was wider than described, and the wider half is fixed.** It was
not only the delete path: `Modal` captures `document.activeElement` on mount, React flushes the
menu item's click synchronously, and `popovertargetaction="hide"` then hides that item - so the
captured element was a button inside a closed popover, still `isConnected` and no longer
focusable. **Cancel** therefore dropped focus to `<body>` too, on a path where nothing had been
destroyed and the restore should simply have worked. `TransactionRowMenu` now focuses the kebab
before opening the dialog, so the captured element is the right one. What survives is only the
original case: a successful delete removes the row and its kebab with it, and there is genuinely
nothing left to focus.

**PET-32 adds a third route to the same surviving case, and it is the longest chain of the three.**
Deleting from *inside* the edit modal unwinds two dialogs: the confirmation restores focus to the
modal's own "Delete transaction" button, which is still attached and correct, and then that modal
unmounts and restores focus onward to the kebab - which died with its row. So focus lands on `<body>`
for the same single reason as before, through one more hop. The ordering that makes the first hop
work is deliberate and pinned (`DeleteTransactionDialog` calls `onDeleted` **after** its own
`close()`); what is unfixed is unchanged, and this is not a second entry.

**PET-34 was asked to look at this and adds no fourth route, which is the useful result.** The
paragraph above predicted that "whoever builds PET-34's detail page should look at it: deleting
from there navigates, which sidesteps the problem for that entry point". That held exactly:
`TransactionDetailActions` passes an `onDeleted` that calls `router.replace`, so the page the
focus would have been restored *into* is gone before the question arises, and there is nothing
here to restore onto. So the count of routes to the surviving case stays at three and the row
menu is still the one that reaches it. **The fix has not become cheaper and has not become
likelier** - what changed is only that the app's newest delete entry point does not need it,
which is worth knowing before somebody reads the absence as the gap having been closed.

**PET-39 adds a fourth route, and it is the same case on a different noun.** Deleting a category
destroys the card kebab that opened the confirmation, so `Modal`'s `isConnected` guard finds
nothing and focus lands on `<body>`. `CategoryCardMenu` carries the same pre-focus fix the row
menu got above, so the Cancel path is correct there from the start and only the successful delete
reaches the gap. Nothing about the fix changes; what changes is that the surviving case is now
reachable from two features rather than one, which is the first time it has been worth counting
that way. PET-38's edit modal will add a fifth by the two-dialog route PET-32 already documents.

### A delete cannot be cancelled once it is sent, and Cancel no longer implies otherwise

A code review asked for an `AbortController` behind the confirmation dialog's Cancel, because
clicking it mid-request closes the box while the delete carries on and the row disappears
anyway. The request is real: AC5 says Cancel leaves the transaction unchanged, and the comment
there presented it as the way out of a hung request.

**An abort was rejected, and the reason is that it would lie.** Aborting the client-to-Server-
Action RPC does not un-delete anything - by the time the user reaches for Cancel the server may
already have removed the row - so the dialog would report a cancellation that did not happen and
then show a list with the row gone. That is strictly worse than the honest version. What shipped
instead is the honesty: Cancel promises only what it can do before Delete is pressed, the
comment says so, and the refresh deliberately outlives the component so the list still agrees
with the database.

A real cancel needs the operation to be cancellable, not the request: a soft delete with an undo
window is the usual shape, and DEL-3's copy ("permanently", "can't be undone") rules it out at
the design level before the engineering starts. Note the backend already tombstones rather than
hard-deleting, so the capability is closer than the copy suggests - which makes this a question
for the designer rather than a limitation to route around.

### The category colour question, answered: the API stores a token, not a hex (PET-64)

This entry used to be an open question. It is a decision record now, kept rather than deleted
because the reasoning is what stops it being reopened.

**The question.** `CategoryResponseDto.color` was a hex string validated with
`/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$/` - any well-formed hex, not one of the palette's eight. A Tailwind class
cannot be built from a hex at runtime without the scanner failing to find it, so
`components/ui/categoryColour.ts` mapped the eight known hexes and fell back to grey for anything
else. That fallback was correct rather than lossy only because no screen could create a category:
the day category writes shipped, whoever built them had to choose between a picker restricted to
the palette and a rendering path that did not go through a class map.

**The answer is the first, and the reason it is not a close call is that hex was never merely
indirect - it was incoherent.** `primary` is the one token daisyUI values differently per theme,
so Entertainment (`#422ad5` light, `#605dff` dark) and Education (`#e0e7ff`, `#edf1fe`) have no
single hex value at all: a stored one would record one and paint the other half the time. So
`categories.color` stores the daisyUI **token** verbatim, `CreateCategoryDto` validates it with
`@IsIn(COLOUR_TOKENS)`, and the seventeen tokens are the palette.

Three things fell out of it that are worth knowing before touching that file:

- **The picker's list and the API's list are deliberately different things.**
  `GET /api/templates/palette` serves what an admin currently has **enabled**, which can be a
  strict subset of what the API accepts - `error-content` ships disabled, because it measures
  1.01:1 against the dark card. A category carrying a since-disabled colour still saves and still
  renders. Validation checks the allowlist; `enabled` is presentation.
- **The inline-`style` alternative is closed off, not merely unchosen.** The class map is now
  keyed by the contract's own union, so `Record<CategoryColour, string>` is an exhaustiveness
  proof: an eighteenth token backend-side breaks the frontend build until the map covers it.
  That guarantee is what an inline `style` would have traded away, and it applies to the 8px dot
  and the donut's SVG `fill` as well as the tile.
- **`FALLBACK_CATEGORY` stopped being the exception.** Its `#98A0AE` was the retired token
  layer's `--color-text-tertiary`; it carries `base-content/50` now and resolves like any other
  category. The neutral grey in `categoryColour.ts` is left for one case only - a `categoryId`
  that matched nothing in the account's list, which is the same colour by a different route.
  PET-64 first put it on `warning-content` and the review of that branch reversed it: nobody had
  measured the token, and it is 1.713:1 against the dark card, which silently undid the fix
  PET-23 had made for this exact row. `COLOUR_CONTRAST` in `template-tokens.ts` is the measured
  table that now exists so the same mistake cannot be made from plausibility again - of the
  sixteen semantic tokens, only `primary` and `secondary` clear 3:1 in both themes.

### An unknown category id in the URL shows no-results with the select reading "All categories"

`parseTransactionFilters` checks that `?categoryId=` is a well-formed UUID and deliberately does
**not** check that it is one of the account's categories. The two reads run in `Promise.all`, so
the category list is not available before the list request goes out, and serialising them would add
a round trip to every load of the app's busiest screen to fix a state only a stale bookmark or a
hand-edited URL reaches.

The outcome is coherent enough: the API filters everything out rather than 404ing, so the screen
shows the no-results card, whose copy already reads "Try a different search term, category or
period". The incoherence is one line of display - the category select falls back to
"All categories" while the URL is filtered by something else, so the bar disagrees with the list
until the next interaction, which heals it.

The fix, if it is ever worth the round trip, is one line between two awaits: drop `categoryId` when
no category matches it. The alternative that costs nothing is to render the unknown id as a
disabled option reading something like "Unknown category", which is new copy A29 would owe.

`isBudgetValid` in `app/setup/draft.ts` and `isAmountValid` in `app/(app)/transactionForm.ts` are
the same one-line rule, `parseAmountInput(value) > 0`, copied rather than shared. Each names the
other in a comment.

The copy is deliberate for now, and the reason is layering rather than laziness: importing would
point the signed-in shell at onboarding, which is the inversion that moved `resendLoginLink` out of
`app/check-email/` into `lib/`. It is also the call `LoginForm` already made about its two field
messages - "copied rather than shared: there is no copy module in this repo and two overlapping
strings are the wrong reason to invent one."

PET-32's Edit transaction modal validates the same field and would make it a third copy, which is
the point at which a shared `lib/amount.ts` earns its place. Whoever writes that should take
`isMerchantValid` and `isNameValid` with it - they are the same pair of twins.

**PET-32 shipped and did not make it a third copy, so the trigger has not fired.** The edit modal
reuses `app/(app)/transactionForm.ts` wholesale - `invalidFields` and all four predicates - rather
than restating the rule, which is what the rule of three is supposed to produce and is why nothing
was lifted. The count is still two. The trigger to watch for is now a third *form* that validates an
amount without going through that module, and the prediction above is left standing rather than
deleted because the reasoning for the lift is unchanged when it does arrive.

**Closed 2026-08-09 by PET-47, on exactly the trigger written above.** The Settings Preferences card
validates a monthly budget, is not a transaction, and cannot reach `app/setup/draft.ts` without
pointing the signed-in shell at onboarding - the layering inversion `lib/resend.ts` was moved out of
`app/check-email/` to remove. `frontend/src/lib/amount.ts` now holds `isPositiveAmount` and
`isFilled`, and the instruction above to "take `isMerchantValid` and `isNameValid` with it" was
followed. **Every existing export keeps its own name and delegates**: `isBudgetValid` reads
correctly in a draft, `isMerchantValid` on a transaction, and renaming four predicates across five
forms would have been churn in service of nothing - so what the lift buys is one copy of each rule
to fix, and deliberately not one vocabulary. No call site changed.

### Screen 24's no-address arrival is new copy and a reworded AC

`/check-email` shows the address the user submitted, and PET-12 carries it in a fifteen-minute
cookie rather than a query string. So there is a real state where the screen has no address: the
cookie expired, the screen was opened in a second browser, or its value was not something the field
could have produced. AC7 asked for copy that "still reads correctly rather than leaving an empty gap
or the literal placeholder" and noted A29 designs none, so the sentence drops the address clause
entirely - `We've sent you a secure login link. Open the link on this device to access your
account.` - chosen over filling the slot with a generic phrase.

**The control in that state is `Log in again`, and that amends AC6's wording.** AC6 requires "Resend
link" to be the only action, and with no address there is nothing to resend. A disabled button
satisfies the letter of it and leaves a screen with no Back, no working control and no way out,
which a reload twenty minutes later reaches - and a permanently disabled button announces as
"Resend link, dimmed" with no reason given. What AC6 defends is that there is no way *backwards*
into a form the user has already completed, and a link forward to Log in does not touch that. The
Jira ticket records the amendment; the alternative is recorded here so nobody re-proposes it.

### The pending-address cookie's lifetime is coupled to a backend variable it cannot read

`lib/pendingEmail.ts` expires its cookie after fifteen minutes to mirror the login link's own
lifetime, which the backend takes from `LOGIN_LINK_TTL_M` (see `docs/guides/configuration.md`). The
frontend has no channel to that value, so the two can drift: raise it and a still-valid link gets
the no-address fallback, lower it and the cookie outlives the link it describes. Both degrade to
copy that reads correctly rather than to anything misleading, which is why the duplication was
accepted rather than fixed. Closing it properly means either publishing the value in the API or
giving the frontend its own environment variable, and neither is worth it for a display string.

### The starter category list is one source now, and what that cost (PET-64)

Also a decision record rather than an open item. The gap was that the names were single-sourced
and the **colours** were not: `backend/src/database/user/starter-categories.ts` owned both, while
`app/setup/starterCategories.ts` (deleted by PET-64) read the names out of the generated contract and
kept its own hand-written mirror of the ten hexes beside them. A colour changed on one side was a
silent divergence.

**The fix this entry asked for is the one that shipped**: a `@Public()` endpoint serving the
starter list, `GET /api/templates/categories`, which deleted the frontend copy outright. The
constraint it named held exactly as written - there is no account and no per-user database during
onboarding, so the endpoint serves template data rather than the caller's own categories, and the
per-user read is still a different endpoint.

What it did not anticipate is that the answer went further than deleting a duplicate. The list is
not a constant behind an endpoint; it is **admin-managed rows** in central's `category_templates`,
which is the first step toward a super-admin panel. Two consequences worth carrying:

- **A compile-time guarantee was traded away, deliberately.** `@IsIn(STARTER_CATEGORY_NAMES)`
  published an OpenAPI enum, so the frontend could carry `AssertNever<Exclude<...>>` and fail
  `npm run build` if the backend ever accepted a name the screen did not offer. Names are
  admin-authored now, so there is no enum and no proof. What replaces it is weaker but sound: the
  ids come from the same endpoint registration validates them against, so the two cannot disagree
  by construction. The colour and icon **kept** their enums, because those reference a code-side
  allowlist - see the colour entry above.
- **Onboarding became network-dependent.** Step 2 rendered from a constant and could not fail; it
  can now, before the user has an account, on a screen A29 designs no error state for.
  `readCategoryTemplates` degrades to an empty list rather than throwing, because Continue is
  unconditional (A4) and an account seeded with just the fallback is a state the flow already
  handles - but the copy for "we could not load your options" is still ours to invent, and it
  joins what A29 owes a designer. `Screens/03 Setup`'s `NoTemplates` story is what to put in front
  of them.

### Step 2 starts with nothing selected, where frame 03 shows seven

The mock has Groceries, Dining out, Transport, Shopping, Housing, Entertainment and Bills
selected. PET-10 treats that as an illustration of the selected state rather than as a default,
by product decision: the user picks. So a first visit renders ten unselected chips and a diff
against the frame shows seven differences, every one of them intended.

Worth a designer answer, because the two readings are genuinely different products - a curated
starter set somebody can pare down, or an empty sheet. If the answer is the mock, the change is
one line in `EMPTY_DRAFT` and **not** in the screen: `parseDraft` preserves an explicitly stored
empty array, so a default in the draft still lets a user deselect everything, while a default
applied in the picker would be re-imposed on every return from step 1 and would leave step 3
submitting something step 2 never showed.

**PET-64 changed both halves of the arithmetic and moved where the answer would live.** A first
visit renders **twelve** chips rather than ten, and four of the mock's seven selected names -
Transport, Shopping, Housing and Bills - are not among them, so a diff against frame 03 now
shows differences of two kinds. And `EMPTY_DRAFT` can no longer carry a default at all: the
draft holds `category_templates` ids, which are minted per environment, so a constant here
would name rows that exist nowhere. If the answer is the mock, the default belongs on the
templates themselves - a `default_selected` column an admin controls, read by the same endpoint
step 2 already calls - which is a cheaper change than this entry's original one, not a dearer
one.

### The category chip's border is 1.5px in both states

Frame 03 draws the unselected chip at 1px and the selected one at 1.5px. `CategoryChip` uses
1.5px for both and changes only the colour, because the chip is auto-sized rather than
full-width: a border that thickened on selection would make it a pixel wider and taller and
nudge, or rewrap, the whole row under the pointer. Half a pixel of border is invisible; a row
that jumps when clicked is not.

The related fact worth knowing before touching that layout: the three rows Figma draws are
`flex-wrap` inside the 600px card, not a grid, and **the browser does not reproduce them.**
Measured in Chrome at 1440x1024: with nothing selected the chips wrap 4 / 4 / 2, because an
unselected chip is about 17px narrower than the same chip with its checkmark; with the mock's
own seven selected they wrap 3 / 3 / 3 / 1, because that third row measures 523px against 520px
of content box. Figma has the same row at 513px, so every chip renders 2 to 3.5px wider here
than the design file measures it.

Two things follow. The 1.5px border on unselected chips is **not** what causes it: at 1px that
row would still come to 521px and still wrap, so reverting the deviation would buy nothing.
And nothing should be done about the rows themselves - CAT-2 and AC1 ask for the ten chips in
the designed **order**, which wrapping preserves. Forcing the picture would mean either a grid,
which breaks at the first long category name, or shaving the designed 10px gap to 8px to win a
coincidence back. Worth a designer glance so the difference is known rather than discovered.

### The budgeting period resolves against one server timezone, not the user's

Every month-scoped figure in the app - the transaction list's period, per-category month
stats, the dashboard's buckets and its days-left tile - is derived by reading a
`YYYY-MM-DD` date against the profile's `monthStartDay`. That needs to know what day it is
now, and PET-35 decided that "now" comes from a single configured `APP_TIMEZONE`
(`Europe/Zagreb`) rather than from UTC or from the user.

UTC was the first instinct and it is wrong for everybody: on the period boundary a
transaction logged just after local midnight falls into the previous period, so the whole
dashboard shows the wrong month for a few hours, twice a month. One configured zone is
right for every user this project actually has, and honest about not solving the general
case.

**The eventual fix is a timezone on the profile, one per user.** It needs a column in the
user scope, a Settings field, and a decision about what to do for accounts that predate it.
None of that exists: no Figma frame collects a timezone, so there is nothing to build
against yet. Until it lands, a user outside the configured zone sees the boundary skew
described above, and the further from `Europe/Zagreb` they are the worse it gets.

Note the config value fails silently when wrong, the same failure class as `use_tursodb` in
`backend/src/database/CLAUDE.md`: nothing crashes, the months are just quietly off.

**PET-24 found the same gap rendering as a wrong word instead of a wrong number.** The
dashboard's recent-transactions caption calls `formatRelativeDate`, whose default `today` reads
`todayIsoDate()` off the frontend host's own local zone - the frontend has no `APP_TIMEZONE`
equivalent to read instead, confirmed by `rg -in --hidden 'APP_TIMEZONE|process.env.TZ|timeZone'
frontend/src frontend/.env.example -g '!node_modules'` finding nothing but the two test files
that set `TZ` on themselves. The window is the **full zone offset**, not an hour - two hours
against `Europe/Zagreb` under CEST and one under CET - the same correction PET-22's review made
to this entry's neighbour above.

**It runs in both directions, and the one worth fixing first is the false positive.** With the
frontend host *behind* the configured zone, which a UTC deployment against `Europe/Zagreb` is,
the frontend's `today` is a day earlier than the backend's for the length of the offset: so a
transaction entered *yesterday* reads "Today" and the one entered *just now* reads its short
date. At 00:30 in Zagreb on 7 August the frontend answers `2025-08-06` while the backend's period
day is `2025-08-07`, and both rows are mislabelled. Ahead of the configured zone only the benign
direction happens - a transaction the backend counts as today's reads its short date instead of
"Today". Every other figure on the page has the identical mismatch and it is silent, because a
wrong number in that window still looks plausible; this is the first place it prints a wrong
*word*, and the only place it prints one that is affirmatively false rather than merely absent.
That is why it is worth a second entry rather than folding into the one above. The fix is the
same one: a zone the frontend reads too, not a second guess bolted onto one formatter.

### Transaction search is case-insensitive for ASCII only

`GET /api/transactions?search=` is a `LIKE '%term%'` on `transactions.merchant`. SQLite's `LIKE`
folds case for ASCII and **only** for ASCII, so `konzum` finds `Konzum` while `kovačić` does not
find `Kovačić`. That is not an exotic edge here: this project's persona is Croatian and its own
example data carries diacritics, so the first realistic search that fails is a plausible one.

**The fix is a normalized search column, which is why it is not in PET-28.** SQLite ships no
`unaccent`, and `PRAGMA case_sensitive_like` would not help - the problem is folding, not
sensitivity. Doing it properly means a `merchant_normalized` column written on every insert and
update, a user-scope migration to add and backfill it, and the search predicate moved onto it.
That is a schema change in a ticket whose whole point was that it stores nothing, and it would
have to be kept in step with `merchant` at three write sites.

Two cheaper things were considered and rejected. Normalizing in JS and comparing in JS means
loading every row to filter it, which is the one thing the index is for. An `ICU` extension is a
native build per platform, and `test-e2e` runs against the embedded driver on a CI runner.

Until then the DTO's own description says so, which is at least honest to a frontend developer
reading the generated types.

**PET-30 is what makes this reachable by a user rather than by a caller.** The transactions page
now renders a no-results state, so a search for `kovačić` against a merchant stored as `Kovačić`
produces a screen saying there are no matching transactions - which is, from the reader's side,
indistinguishable from having none. The copy that ships tells them to try a different search term,
which happens to be correct advice for the wrong reason. Worth revisiting together with the
normalized column rather than separately.

### The Fly MCP server is declined; the flyctl workflow becomes a repo skill instead

`flyctl` ships an experimental MCP server behind `fly mcp server --claude`, evaluated on
2026-08-04 while PET-53 was being set up. Probed over stdio it identifies as `FlyMCP 🚀 0.4.77`
and exposes 60 tools: `fly-apps-*`, `fly-machine-*` (19 of them), `fly-volumes-*`,
`fly-secrets-*`, `fly-certs-*`, `fly-ips-*`, `fly-orgs-*`, `fly-platform-*`, plus `fly-status`
and `fly-logs`.

Declined, for three reasons. It has no `fly deploy` and no `fly launch` tool, so the deploy
itself goes through `flyctl` in a shell either way, and `scale`, `config`, `proxy`, `ssh` and
`mpg` are absent too. Sixty tool schemas would enter every request's context to buy only the
reads that remain. And it flattens the permission surface: `fly-apps-destroy`,
`fly-orgs-delete` and `fly-volumes-destroy` arrive as ordinary tool calls, whereas
`Bash(flyctl status:*)` in `.claude/settings.json` can allowlist the safe reads on their own.

This is the exact inverse of the Turso CLI entry under `## Operational`, and worth holding both
in mind together: there the CLI is broken and the MCP server is the way through, here the CLI is
complete and the MCP server is the partial one. "Is there an MCP server" is not the question;
"which of the two is whole" is. Fly publishes no official skill either, and the `flyio-pack`
results that surface in a search are third-party and unvetted.

**Queued:** a repo skill wrapping `flyctl` via Bash, written once PET-53's deploy actually works
and there is a real sequence to encode. Writing it earlier would invent the workflow rather than
record it.

- **A generated HTTP client is not decided.** Types are shared and that part is settled:
  response shapes come out of `backend/openapi.json`, so a caller derives its type rather than
  restating it. What is open is whether the calls themselves get wrapped. A generated client
  would fight Next.js caching, because a Server Component passes `cache` and `next` options
  straight to `fetch`; `openapi-fetch` is the upgrade worth considering, because it delegates to
  global `fetch` and passes `RequestInit` through untouched. Recorded here because the old
  README was its only home outside a frozen plan file.

### Income is not a category, and adding one would be the worst way to support it

This app has no concept of money coming in, and that is recorded rather than overlooked:
`docs/project-management/01-brief-personal-expense-tracker.md` says "every amount is an expense;
nothing records money coming in", and ADD-4 with A13 says "amounts are entered as positive numbers
and rendered as negative expenses everywhere else. There is no income concept."
`transactions.amount_cents` is a plain magnitude with no sign, and `formatNegative` applies the
minus at render time. So "expense" is not a property of a row here, it is an assumption baked into
the type.

The question that keeps arising is whether a salary could just be a category, either a new
`Income` one or folded into an existing one. **It cannot, and the category answer is worse than
doing nothing, because it fails silently.** A positive amount in an `Income` category is
indistinguishable from spending to every aggregate in the app: `DashboardService`'s `spent` sums
the transaction list, so payday inflates it; the donut renders Income as the largest slice of
"spending by category"; `averagePerDay` becomes meaningless; a weekly bar spikes; `BudgetCard` can
read over budget *because* the user got paid; `topCategory` is always Income. A `monthlyCap` on
income is nonsense, and the status bands invert with it, so `over` would mean "earned more than
expected" and render in the danger colour. `RuleBasedInsightGenerator` would warn about the
over-cap and project income as spend. Nothing there throws; the numbers are simply wrong on every
screen.

**The axis income differs on is the transaction, not the category.** Supporting it means a sign or
a `type` on `transactions` - additively, so it satisfies this file's own rule about a user-scope
migration running unattended one user at a time - and then every aggregate in `CategoriesService`,
`TransactionsService`, `DashboardService` and `RuleBasedInsightGenerator` filtering or signing on
it. That is a large ticket and it does not exist.

**The tempting middle option is an `isIncome` flag on the category, and it should be rejected.**
Aggregates would exclude flagged categories, which is cheap, but it makes a row's meaning depend on
its category, so recategorising a transaction silently flips its sign. The case that settles it is
**refunds**: a supermarket refund should reduce Groceries rather than count as income, and no
category-level flag can express that while a transaction-level sign can.

**PET-64 makes this cheaper later rather than harder.** Once category templates live in central,
income categories are a `kind` column (`expense` | `income`) on `category_templates` plus a filter
in the picker: admin-managed rows, no new mechanism, no user-data migration. So the template work
is worth doing before this rather than after, and this entry exists so the next person costing
income starts from the transaction model instead of from the category list.

### PET-59's receipt scanning deferred six things, each for a reason recorded on the ticket

`POST /api/transactions/scan` extracts a transaction's fields from a photo or PDF and stores
nothing, but six things the plan considered are not in this build. Each is a decision rather
than an oversight, and each is recorded here rather than only in
`docs/plans/2026-08-06_PET-59_receipt-scanning.md` so it survives that plan being superseded.

**A per-scan training opt-in, blocked on the Settings screen.** The free tier's terms mean
everything the request carries is used to improve Google's models on every scan - the receipt
image, up to 50 merchant names and every category name, inventoried in `backend/CLAUDE.md`;
V1 answers that with an on-screen disclosure line rather than a toggle, because a real opt-in
needs a new profile column, a migration, an `api:sync` and a screen to host it - none of which
exist while Settings' `<main>` is empty. Migrating the whole project to the paid tier is the
*only* mechanism that actually turns training off; a $10 prepay to buy that for a portfolio
app's seeded test data was judged not worth it. Revisit both the toggle and the tier once
Settings has a `<main>` and once this app has a real user.
**PET-46 gave it that `<main>`, so the last clause of the paragraph above is satisfied and the
blocker is now the other three items on its own list.** There is a real `<form>` on `/settings` to
host a toggle, and adding one is a profile column, a migration and an `api:sync` - the screen is no
longer among the missing pieces. The tier question is untouched, and it is still the only mechanism
that turns training off.

**A shared-store aggregate cap on the Gemini quota.** The `scan` throttler is per-user and its
store is in-memory (see "The auth throttler is in-memory" below, which the same store serves),
so it buys fairness and blast radius - one account in a retry loop cannot outrun everybody else
- and nothing more. N users each sitting at their own limit can still exhaust the shared
free-tier quota between them, and more than one Fly machine gives each user a fresh bucket per
machine on top of that. A genuine cap needs a shared store and a global counter, which is a
real piece of infrastructure this project has not needed before.

**A page-count guard on a scanned PDF.** Gemini reads PDFs natively, which is what makes
accepting one cheap enough to ship - but the backend has no PDF parser, so it cannot look at a
PDF's page count before sending it. A 40-page bank statement is accepted up to the 4MB size cap
and billed as roughly 10,000 tokens of prompt describing no receipt at all. The 4MB cap bounds
the damage today; an explicit guard needs a parser this project does not carry for anything
else.

**Scanning several distinct receipts into several transactions.** The modal writes one
`POST /transactions`, so every image in a scan request is synthesized into one extraction - the
multi-image control is for pages of *one* receipt, never a batch. A real batch import needs a
review queue, N draft rows and a bulk write, none of which the current endpoint or modal can
express; it is a different feature rather than an extension of this one; and it is why the
upload control is labelled "Upload receipt" rather than "Upload receipts" - the plural would
promise exactly this and silently lose every receipt but the one the model led with.

**Sliding the frontend's per-image compression numbers against real devices.** `maxSizeMB:
0.75` and `maxWidthOrHeight: 2000` (`frontend/src/lib/receiptCompression.ts`) are the plan's
starting point rather than a measurement against real receipt photos on real hardware. If OCR
accuracy or the 413 rate ever becomes a visible problem, this is the first pair of numbers to
revisit, and it wants a phone in hand rather than a guess from a desk.

**A way to make a scan correct an earlier scan's mistake.** The review of this branch found the
merge could not honour its own doc: `mergeScannedFields` locks a field once a scan has filled it,
which is what "Add pages" has to mean - that control sends only the newly picked file, the model
reads that page on its own, and page 2's re-reading of the merchant would otherwise replace page
1's correct one. The price is paid by the other control. The camera reads "Scan again" after a
success and goes through the identical handler, so a user whose first photo produced a wrong
merchant cannot fix it by rephotographing; they edit the field, which is one keystroke and
unambiguous, but it is not what the label promises. Two ways out, neither taken here because both
are product decisions rather than review fixes: split the two controls so the camera replaces and
the picker augments, which makes one button's semantics invisible until it is pressed; or let a
scan overwrite a previous scan while still respecting typed fields, which puts page 2's guess back
on top of page 1's reading. Worth a designer's answer alongside the copy A29 already owes this
feature, and worth knowing that the desktop path has only the augmenting control at all, since
the camera is `pointer-fine:hidden`.

### The receipt scan's "Cancel scan" does not cancel anything, and PET-73 builds the mechanism that would

`AddTransactionModal`'s overlay offers "Cancel scan", and what it cancels is the **caller's interest
in the answer**, not the work. It invalidates a ref-held generation counter so a late result is
discarded; the request finishes server side, Gemini is still called, and the tokens are still spent.
`frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md` says so plainly already ("There is no client-side abort for a scan in
flight, only a soft one") and gives the reason: calling a Server Action exposes no `AbortController` a
client component can reach, so `RECEIPT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS` on the backend is the only real bound.

That was the right call for PET-59 and it is worth revisiting now for one reason: **PET-73 builds the
real version for the assistant**, and once that pattern exists here, the scan is the second consumer
rather than a lone exception. Its three hops are a browser-owned `AbortController`, a route handler
passing `request.signal` through, and a backend combining a request-close signal with the existing
timeout via `AbortSignal.any`. The plain-language version of all of that is
`docs/explainers/cancelling-an-ai-request.md`.

**Two things make the scan a harder retrofit than the assistant was, which is why this is not simply
"do the same thing".** The send is `authorizedPostFormData` over **multipart** form data rather than
JSON, so the frontend route handler it would need has to stream a file body through rather than
forward a parsed object, and `next.config.ts`'s `bodySizeLimit` stops being the relevant bound the
moment the action becomes a `fetch`. And a scan is genuinely cheap next to a chat turn: one image
against 40k tokens of spending history, so the money argument that justifies the work for the
assistant is much weaker here. What survives is the honesty argument, which is real on its own: a
button labelled "Cancel scan" that does not cancel the scan is a claim the UI cannot keep, and
`pointer-fine:hidden` means the phone path (where a slow upload is likeliest) is where it matters
most.

Do it **after** PET-73 has landed and its hop 3 has been verified in a browser, not alongside it.
Hop 3 is the half with no precedent and a live trap (Express fires `close` on a completed response as
well as on a dropped connection, so an unguarded listener aborts its own successful reply), and
proving it once on the feature that needs it is worth more than proving it twice at once. Related:
the aggregate-quota entry above, since a cancel that reaches Google is the only thing that stops an
abandoned request counting against the shared free-tier budget.

### `CardBanner`'s dark theme measures 4.13:1, below the AA floor

PET-38's browser walk measured the accent strip both category cards and the summary card sit on,
compositing the text over the background and reading the pixel back rather than trusting
`getComputedStyle`. Light measures **6.75:1** and passes. **Dark measures 4.13:1**, where AA wants
4.5:1 for text this size - the strip is `bg-primary` and everything on it is `text-primary-content`,
which was stock daisyUI when this was measured, so at the time nothing in this repo had chosen
those two values. (PET-74's third addendum narrowed where the strip appears: the uncapped category
cards carry an in-row `btn-primary` "Set limit" pill instead, which is the same colour pairing at
button size, so the summary card's "Allocate" strip is the only remaining instance of the strip
itself.)

**The action and the sentence beside it measure identically, on both cards**, which is what says the
finding belongs to the strip rather than to any one control. It has been there since PET-36 built
`CardBanner`; PET-38 only made one of its buttons live, and if anything improved that button by
dropping the `opacity-60` the inert state carried.

Not fixed there because both available fixes are decisions rather than refactors. Re-theming
`primary-content` was forbidden outright when this was written; PET-74 made the theme this repo's
own, so that fix is available now at the price the guard sets - it repaints a category colour and
re-triggers the palette re-measurement. Changing the strip's colour pair is a
design call on a component the team's Claude Design system supplied, whose own note says the tinted
variant "was too quiet to notice". The numbers are recorded here so whoever picks one starts from a
measurement instead of an impression, and so a theme change is seen to move them.

PET-74 is that theme change, and it moved them exactly as predicted: under the Expensa pair the
strip computes to **5.35:1 light** (passing) and **3.90:1 dark** - marginally below the stock
dark's 4.13:1, the same class of failure, and the entry stays open. The fix now lives in
`globals.css`'s theme blocks rather than upstream, and it was not taken unilaterally because a
lighter dark `primary-content` spends the Lavender/Blush closeness margin the picker already
runs on.

### `Uncategorized` cannot be renamed or capped from the UI

PET-38 gave the fallback card no kebab and no banner, because `PATCH /api/categories/:id` refuses to
rename that row and `DELETE` refuses to remove it, so a menu on it held nothing operable. The API
does accept a **cap** on it, and there is now no control anywhere that sets one.

Deliberate, and the alternatives were weighed: a menu holding a single Edit whose Name field alone
was greyed out is three explanations deep on the one category nobody asked for, and a live "Set
limit" on a card with no other affordance would have made Edit reachable one way and not the other.
What would change the call is a reason for a user to cap the fallback - which is really a question
about whether unfiled spending should count against a budget line, and nothing in the design asks it
yet. Both 409s stay classified in `lib/deleteCategory.ts` and `lib/updateCategory.ts` regardless,
because a control that is not drawn is not an enforcement.

### A stored colour or icon the palette no longer offers reads as "Select…"

`GET /api/templates/palette` returns `enabled` rows only, so an admin disabling a token a user
already has produces a category whose mark matches no row in either picker - and both derive their
trigger label by finding that row. The Edit modal therefore shows "Select…" beside a swatch that is
painting the correct colour, which reads as "unset" for a value that is very much set.

Nothing is lost by it: `toUpdateCategoryBody` omits a mark that was not touched, so saving any other
field leaves the stored token alone, and `categoryColour.ts` supplies the swatch and the glyph
independently of the palette. What is missing is a **label** for a token the palette declines to
describe, which is a contract question - either the palette carries disabled rows with a flag, or
the response for a single category carries its own labels - rather than something either picker can
answer locally. The same gap exists in `IconSelect`.

### PET-72's own five deferrals, each recorded on the ticket

**A wider currency list needs a per-currency exponent first.** `toCents`/`fromCents` assume an
exponent of 2, so `SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES` is an allowlist of exponent-2 codes and `UpdateProfileDto` validates
against that list rather than against `@IsISO4217CurrencyCode()` - which accepts `JPY` (exponent 0)
and `KWD` (exponent 3) and would turn every figure in the app into a silent factor of 100 or 1000.
Supporting them is a real feature and it is not a longer list: it is an exponent per code, threaded
through both conversion functions, every `Intl` call and the amount field's hand-built grouping.

**PET-85 cut that allowlist from twenty-nine codes to three (`EUR`, `USD`, `GBP`), which changes the
count this entry is stated against and none of its conclusion.** Read the narrowing as a product
decision rather than a technical retreat: the twenty-nine were every exponent-2 ISO code, which is
the right question for a validator and the wrong one for a picker, and the picker they were rendered
into had been built and measured for three - so it overflowed the viewport by 294px with no scroll
container, and a platform popover cannot be scrolled to. The entry above still describes what a
genuinely wider list needs, and it is now the *second* thing such a list needs: the first is somebody
choosing which codes to offer, which is what settles the tech spec's **A6**.

**Correcting a history row has no endpoint.** The three histories are append-only and nothing edits or
removes a row, so a schedule change made from the wrong paycheck can only be answered with another one
- which leaves both rows and resolves to the newer. Right for a record of decisions, wrong for a typo,
and the two are indistinguishable from the API. Deleting the mistaken row means publishing row ids the
API currently exposes nowhere.

**The paycheck dialog is invented copy and owes A29 a sign-off.** SET-5 draws one "Save changes" and no
dialog at all, so its title, body, field label and glyph are all ours - `Shell/Paycheck month`'s
stories are the only review, and `Retroactive` and `Future` are the two to look at hardest, being the
two readings of one sentence. The nine-month window (four back, four forward) is the other open
question: it is what makes the two backend 400s unreachable from the UI, so widening it means checking
both guards again.

**`/insights` pays one extra request for its overline.** `GET /api/insights` publishes no period - a
set is generated for the current period only, and its `monthLabel` names the period it was generated
*in* - so that page calls `GET /api/periods` beside its own read purely to name the header. The two run
in parallel and the endpoint is arithmetic over one small table, so this is cheap rather than free. A
`period` on the insights response would remove it, at the cost of a field describing something the set
is not about.

**A period's label has one length, so the Categories heading carries the year.** It reads "October 2025
spending" where the design draws "October spending", because the backend publishes exactly one label
per period and a shorter form would mean deriving a month name from a period again - which is precisely
what cannot be done once a pay-day change can stretch one. A second, shorter label on the response is
the fix if a designer wants the frame's version back; deriving it on the frontend is not.

### The central template seed is not applied by a deploy, and it has been missed twice

`openCentralDatabase` seeds `colour_templates`, `icon_templates` and `category_templates` after
`migrate()`, guarded on "any `category_templates` row exists" - and that guard is what makes a change to
`COLOUR_SEED`, `ICON_SEED` or `CATEGORY_SEED` **invisible on any environment whose central database is
already seeded**. The guard is deliberate for the reason `backend/src/database/CLAUDE.md` gives: it is
not only idempotence, it is what stops a restart re-creating a template an admin deliberately deleted.
So a deploy carrying a new colour or a renamed template applies the migration and skips the data, with
nothing failing. It has now been missed twice, both times found by opening the app and wondering why a
picker was short an entry. The fix is a real one-shot mechanism - a seed-version row the boot path
compares against, or an admin endpoint - and until it exists, **a seed change needs a manual step
against every environment**, which is the thing to write into the ticket that makes one.
### The hairline cards, the type/spacing pass and component behaviours still drift from Claude Design

PET-74 closed the colour-and-radius half of the design drift with the Expensa theme pair and
deliberately stopped there, so three gaps remain, each a candidate ticket rather than a queue item.
The `shadow-*` utilities in markup (roughly forty call sites; `rg -o 'shadow-[a-z0-9]+' frontend/src`
for the current set) keep daisyUI shadows where Claude Design is "a hairline system, not a shadow
system" - cards carry a 1px inset ring and only menus and modals get drop shadows, per the design
project's `tokens/elevation.css`. Per-element type sizes and spacing stay Tailwind's own scale. And
how components open and animate is daisyUI component CSS that no theme variable reaches, so matching
Claude Design there means fighting the plugin's cascade per component - judged not worth doing at
all, where the first gap is mechanical-but-wide and the second is a design pass.

**The type half of that is closed by PET-79 and the other two are not**, so read this entry as
naming two gaps rather than three. The typography audit it asked for happened, answered "not no
change", and carried out the pass: Plus Jakarta Sans became **Crimson Pro** and 25 `font-display`
sites moved up a step - or two, for `text-lg` - to keep their optical height, because Crimson Pro's
caps are 76.9% of the old face's. `frontend/CLAUDE.md` carries the table and the reasoning, and
`docs/explainers/font-pairing-review.html` is the evidence fourteen candidates were measured
against. What is emphatically **not** closed is *spacing*, which that sentence bundles with type and
which nothing in PET-79 touched. The `shadow-*` hairline pass and the component-animation gap are
both untouched and both still candidate tickets.

### Three theme slots are invented values owing a designer sign-off

The design sources define no `info`, `secondary` or `accent`, and all three are category-picker
colours in their own right, so PET-74 filled them from the Figma category ramp: Sky `#3f8ee6`,
Teal `#34b9ae`, and the ramp's pink deepened to `#c1519e` so its Blush tile pairing clears 3:1.
The five dark `-content` casts (Pine, Navy, Forest, Umber, Maroon) are derivations too - Figma
drew none of them. Every value is measured (`COLOUR_CONTRAST`, both explainers) but none is
designed; they join what A29 already owes a designer.

**Still open after PET-79, and it reviewed them rather than resolving them.** That ticket put all
three through the automated guard and they pass every check it makes - `info` reads 3.374:1 light and
4.861:1 dark against the card, `secondary` 4.253 and 3.857, and `accent` 2.415 and 6.793, which is a
category colour rather than a control and so not floored. Passing a measurement is not a sign-off,
which is the whole point of this entry, so no value moved. Two things did change around it: "both
explainers" is now the single generated `docs/explainers/category-palette-preview.html`, and
`COLOUR_CONTRAST` covers five themes rather than two - so a designer looking at these three can now
see them under every theme the app ships.

### ~~The explainer theme blocks restate `globals.css` and nothing checks the copies~~ (closed by PET-79)

Five files under `docs/explainers/` embed the Expensa theme values in a `<style>` block, because
the pinned CDN `daisyui.css` carries only the stock themes and the pages exist to paint what the
app paints. That is six hand-held copies of the palette - `globals.css` plus five - kept in step
by a comment in each file and by nothing else; `npm run docs:check` verifies single-source prose,
not CSS blocks. A small script diffing each block against the theme blocks in `globals.css` would
close it, and belongs with the next theme edit if not sooner.

**PET-79 was that edit and this is closed, by a Jest gate rather than the script this entry asked
for.** `frontend/src/lib/themeGuard.test.ts` diffs every embedded block against the two
`@plugin 'daisyui/theme'` blocks and fails naming the file, the block and the token. Three things
about the shape are worth knowing before touching those pages.

It is **three files rather than five**, because PET-79 merged `category-color-palette-preview.html`
and `category-colors-icons-description-preview.html` into one generated, theme-aware page - which
removes two hand-held copies rather than checking them, and is the better half of the fix.

The diff reads **every `--color-*`, not the seventeen-token category allowlist**, because a diff that
filtered would leave whatever it dropped free to drift - and `--color-orange` and its content pair
live in exactly that gap, being in every theme block and in no allowlist.

And it checks **every token a block declares** rather than every token the theme has: a dark block
carries only the six values that differ between the pair plus a redundant-but-identical
`--color-neutral`, where the light block carries all twenty-two, so a check demanding 22-for-22 in
both would have reported false failures. It does compare the **two dark blocks against each other**,
since they are hand-maintained copies of one another, and that arm was watched firing.

The same ticket renamed each page's `[data-theme='dark']` to `[data-theme='expensa-dark']`, which had
become genuinely ambiguous: stock `dark` is a registered theme now, so one attribute named the
Expensa palette in these files and daisyUI's own in the app. The suite pins that absence too.

## Operational

### Unverified registrations accumulate, and hold their address

Registering no longer costs a database, but it still writes a central row that holds the
email against the partial unique index. Nobody has to prove the address is theirs to do it,
so anyone can register an address they do not own and rows pile up for accounts that will
never be verified. The squatting itself is self-healing - a genuine owner's registration
overwrites the stashed payload, and only they can click the link - but the rows are not.
Give unverified rows an expiry and a sweep before this is deployed anywhere public.

### Gmail still threads the login emails

Observed on 2026-08-02 against a real inbox: four links to the same address collapsed into
one Gmail thread, because every message has an identical sender and subject. The user
therefore opens one conversation holding several indistinguishable emails, of which exactly
one works. That is the invalidation behaving as specified, and the sharp edge is now
answerable rather than a dead end: verify returns **409** for a superseded link, distinct
from the 401 every other dead token gets, so the verify page can say "this link was replaced
by a newer one, open the most recent email". If inbox confusion persists anyway, varying the
subject - appending a short local time is the usual trick - remains available, and costs
only a slightly uglier subject line.

### A real send can land in spam, despite correct DKIM

Observed on 2026-08-05: a login email delivered to the project inbox (`spendifico@gmail.com`)
landed in the inbox, the same email to a personal Gmail address landed in spam. Checked at the
DNS level rather than by header, since the Gmail API this project can reach exposes no
`Authentication-Results`: `ohmysmtp._domainkey.spendifico.eu` carries a real DKIM public key -
MailPace's engine descends from OhMySMTP, hence the selector name - so DKIM is correctly
configured and `docs/guides/email.md` step 1 is genuinely done. SPF
(`v=spf1 include:_spf.porkbun.com ~all`) does not authorize MailPace, which is not a gap: without
MailPace's "Advanced Verification" CNAME, sends carry a `Return-Path` on MailPace's own domain, so
SPF authenticates there instead - and DMARC needs only one of SPF or DKIM aligned with the visible
`From:`, which DKIM already satisfies (`d=spendifico.eu`). `_dmarc.spendifico.eu` is
`v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none;`, monitor-only.

So authentication is not the cause. The likely one is plain sender reputation on a domain that has
sent a handful of emails ever, which is largely orthogonal to DNS and improves with real volume
over time - not something a repo config fixes. Worth knowing before reading a spam-foldered smoke
test as a broken setup.

### In cloud mode the remote is a schema behind, briefly

Observed on 2026-08-03 while smoke-testing verification against Turso Cloud: reading the
central database remotely moments after boot failed with `no such column:
onboarding_payload`, then succeeded a minute later with no intervening deploy.

That is the embedded replica working as designed rather than a migration failure.
Migrations are applied to the **local** replica at boot, and `turso-client.factory.ts`
pushes on the `TURSO_SYNC_INTERVAL_S` beat (60s by default), so for up to one interval the
cloud copy legitimately lacks both the new DDL and any rows written since. The app is
unaffected - it reads and writes its own replica - but anything looking at the remote is:
the Turso MCP, the CLI, Studio, and any dashboard. Worth knowing before someone debugs a
phantom "migration did not run" for a minute, and worth remembering when a deploy is
verified by querying the cloud database directly.

### Revoking somebody else's session is a manual tombstone

**Narrowed by PET-84, not closed.** A user can now end their **own** session: the sidebar
footer's logout control posts to `POST /api/auth/logout`, which tombstones the row its bearer
belongs to. So the half of this entry that said "there is no endpoint that ends a session" is
history, and the sentence about A39 designing no logout is too - the product owner overruled it.

What is left is the operator's half, unchanged. Revoking a session **somebody else** holds still
means setting `sessions.deleted_at` by hand - `validate()` filters on it, so the next request
with that token answers 401 - and so does revoking **every** session of one user, which
`sessions_user_id_idx` exists to make one statement. Neither has tooling. Write it before an
incident needs it, not during one.

Two things worth knowing before that tooling is written. The endpoint deliberately revokes only
the presented bearer, so it is not a building block for "sign out everywhere": that wants the
index and a control of its own on Settings, and `frontend/src/lib/logOut.ts` records why it was
kept out of the footer. And `revoke()` guards on the tombstone being null, so tooling that writes
this column should do the same rather than overwriting a timestamp that already answers "when".

### A logout during a backend outage is a local sign-out only

**PET-84, and it is a decision with a stated cost rather than an omission.** The logout action
clears the session cookie whatever the API answers, because clearing it only on a 2xx would leave
a user unable to sign out of their own browser on the one screen whose purpose is leaving. So
during an outage the browser is signed out while the token stays live in the database until
`SESSION_TTL_D`, and the user is told it worked - which, from where they stand, it did.

**Nothing reports that**, and the reason is that there is nowhere to report it to: the frontend
has no logging seam at all, no `console.error` anywhere under `src/`, so the choice was to invent
one for a line nothing reads or to record the asymmetry. If a logging or error-reporting seam ever
lands, this is a caller for it. Until then the entry above is the operator's recourse.

### A verify that fails twice can orphan a cloud database

Verification creates the user's database and persists the pointer to it inside one
compensated block: if either step fails, it deletes the database and rethrows. If that
delete _also_ fails, a cloud database exists that no row points at, the central row's
`db_url` stays NULL, and every later verification of that account 500s on the name
collision. The failure is logged in full by `VerificationService`, naming the database.

The fix is manual and one step: delete `spendifico-user-<id>` through the Turso MCP server or
the Platform API - never the CLI, for the name-cache reason below. The next resent link then
provisions cleanly.

### Two verifies of one account can overlap, across a resend

`consume()` makes each _link_ single-use, but nothing serializes verification per
_account_: while a first verify is still provisioning (a window of seconds), a resend plus
a click on the new link starts a second verify against the same half-built account. In
cloud mode the second create then collides on the database name and its compensation
deletes the database out from under the first; in local mode both can pass the seed's
empty check and duplicate the starter categories. Reaching it takes a user who resends and
clicks while the first click has not answered yet, so it is accepted at this scale - the
same single-instance reasoning as the throttler and the migration lock. If it ever bites,
the shape of the fix is a per-user in-process queue around provisioning, which is the
`issueQueue` pattern `LoginTokenService` already uses.

### The auth throttler is in-memory

`@nestjs/throttler` uses its default in-memory storage, so the limit is **per backend
instance**: two instances give an attacker twice the budget. Same single-instance
assumption as the migration lock below, and one more reason the deployment runs exactly one
machine.

The proxy half of this entry is resolved, but not on the first try: `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` shipped
as `1`, and a phone-tether check against an exhausted bucket got 429 - proof every caller was
still landing in one shared bucket. Fly's real topology puts two hops in front of the app for a
direct client (the real address, then the app's own IP, appended by Fly's internal routing
before the request reaches the machine), confirmed by capturing the raw header through a
throwaway diagnostic route and replaying it offline against the same Express stack. The value is
now `2`, and it is exact rather than a safe margin: replaying a client-forged prefix through the
same stack showed 2 correctly ignores it while 3 or higher trusts it, so raising this number
"to be safe" does the opposite. See `backend/CLAUDE.md` for why it is a hop count rather than a
boolean and the full replay methodology, `backend/fly.toml`'s comment for the value, and
`docs/guides/deployment.md`'s per-IP check for how to catch a regression here.

**PET-11 made that second half real, and it is no longer a deployment-time worry.** The
register call goes through a Next Server Action, so the backend sees the *frontend server's*
address on every registration and there is exactly one per-IP bucket for the whole
application. At the default of 30 per 15 minutes, thirty registrations from anywhere lock
out everybody; as an abuse control it now does nothing at all. PET-12's login-link actions
inherit the same shape. The per-email limiter still works correctly, and it is the one that
actually protects this flow, which is why this is degraded rather than broken.

The fix is two-sided and neither half works alone: the frontend has to forward the real
client address, and the backend has to be told how many hops to trust. **Do not bolt on
either half in isolation.** Forwarding a client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` and then trusting
it makes the limiter *spoofable*, which is worse than blind - and the backend is publicly
reachable, so a custom header like `X-Client-IP` is no better without authentication between
the two apps, which does not exist. Getting this right means deciding the hop count against
the real topology (PET-53's Fly.io deploy, plus whatever sits in front) and probably
authenticating the frontend to the backend. That is its own ticket, not a line in a form.

### Token rotation is manual

By MVP decision every Turso token is created with **Expires: NEVER**: the control-plane
token, the central database token, and every per-user token minted at registration. There
is no refresh logic anywhere, which is the point. The cost is that a leaked token never
dies on its own.

Rotation is a deliberate ops action:

```bash
turso db tokens invalidate spendifico-app        # central database
turso auth api-tokens revoke spendifico-backend  # control plane
```

Per-user tokens live in the central `users.db_auth_token` column, so rotating those means
re-minting and updating the rows. No tooling exists for that yet; write it before it is
needed urgently rather than during an incident.

### The Turso CLI has a stale name cache, and it bites this project constantly

With CLI v1.0.31, `turso db shell spendifico-user-<uuid>` reports "database not found" and
`turso db destroy spendifico-user-<uuid> --yes` exits 0 having done nothing, while `turso db
show` and `turso db list` handle the identical name perfectly.

**Cause, confirmed on 2026-08-01.** The CLI caches the organization's database names in
`~/.config/turso/settings.json` under `cache.database_names`, with a short TTL. `db shell`
and `db destroy` resolve the name against that cache instead of the API. Any database
created by something other than this CLI is therefore invisible to them until the cache
expires. That is _every_ per-user database, since the backend creates them through the
Platform API, which is why `spendifico-app` and `jura` work (both created via the CLI) and
`spendifico-user-*` never does. Nothing to do with the name being long, which was the first
guess.

Note that `turso db list` does **not** refresh the cache, so the error message's advice to
"List known databases using turso db list" does not help.

Three ways around it, best first:

1. **Use the Turso MCP server.** It goes straight to the API and has no cache.
   `read_database`, `evolve_schema` and `delete_database` all worked on a
   freshly-created `spendifico-user-<uuid>` in the same session where the CLI refused.
2. **Expire the cache**, after which the CLI falls back to the API and works:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json;p='$HOME/.config/turso/settings.json';d=json.load(open(p));d['cache']['database_names']['expiration']=0;json.dump(d,open(p,'w'))"
   ```
3. **Use the Platform REST API directly**, which is what the backend does:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(grep '^TURSO_ORG_TOKEN=' backend/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
   curl -X DELETE "https://api.turso.tech/v1/organizations/<org>/databases/<name>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
   ```

Worth retesting after a CLI upgrade; this looks like a plain bug rather than a design
decision. Inspecting the central directory is unaffected either way:
`turso db shell spendifico-app "select id, email from users;"`.

### Text primary keys are nullable at the database level

SQLite's historic quirk lets a non-INTEGER primary key hold NULL, and the Turso engine
inherits it (verified with a direct insert). Both `id` columns carry `.notNull()` in the
Drizzle schemas, but drizzle-kit's sqlite DDL generator emits no `NOT NULL` for a
primary-key column, so the constraint exists only app-side: every id comes from `newId()`.
Two limitations were confirmed in `drizzle-kit@1.0.0-rc.4` while trying to fix this
properly:

- the sqlite **differ only sees created and dropped entities**, so any in-place change to
  an existing index or column (a new `where` clause, a new `NOT NULL`) generates
  `no_changes`. The partial email index worked around it by renaming the index;
- the sqlite **DDL generator drops `notNull` on primary-key columns** entirely, so even a
  rename-style workaround cannot produce the constraint.

The `.notNull()` stays in the schemas so a future drizzle-kit that fixes the generator
picks it up on the next diff. If that lands, expect a table-recreate migration for both
scopes; review it rather than being surprised by it.

### Changing an email address leaves three loose ends, all accepted

`PATCH /api/profile` moves the login identifier, and PET-45 took three residuals knowingly
rather than by omission.

**The uniqueness pre-check can lose a race.** The update reads `users` for the requested
address and answers 409 before writing anything, but two concurrent PATCHes claiming one new
address both pass that read. The loser then violates the partial unique index _after_ its
profile fields have already persisted, and answers a logged 500 rather than a 409. It is
retry-safe - the retry gets an honest 409, or succeeds - and it needs two people racing for
one address in the same instant. Closing it means sniffing a driver-specific constraint error
and translating it, which is worth doing the day this backend runs more than one instance,
since the same window is what `sessions` and `login_links` already tolerate.

**Login links already in flight keep working, and they point at the old address.** A link is
a row keyed to a user id, not to an email, so one issued before the change still verifies
afterwards - it just arrived in an inbox the account no longer answers to. That is in spec
rather than a bug: AC6 governs where _subsequent_ links are sent, and the window is bounded
by `LOGIN_LINK_TTL_M`. Standard account-takeover hygiene would supersede every live link on
an address change, which is one `UPDATE` in `LoginTokenService` whenever it is wanted.

**Nothing tells the old address it lost the account.** The usual defence against a hijacked
session quietly moving the login identifier is a notification to the previous address, and
there is none: the change answers 200 and only the new address ever hears about it. A39
designs no security-alert mail, so adding one is a product decision before it is a code one.
(This clause used to say A39 designs no logout either. PET-84 overruled that half and built
one, which changes nothing here: a logout ends the session its holder is using, and this
entry is about the session's *other* holder never being told.)

### Autostop is available as a cost lever, and was measured before being rejected

`auto_stop_machines = "stop"` would take the machine charge from roughly $3.32/month to near
zero, leaving only the $0.15 volume. It was configured, deployed and measured on 2026-08-05,
then reverted, and the numbers are recorded so nobody has to repeat the experiment.

It works correctly. The proxy logs `has excess capacity, autostopping machine`, sends the
configured `kill_signal`, and the shutdown flush completes - both bracket lines were observed.
The 30s health check does not keep the machine alive. It does not breach the single-instance
rule either, since autostart starts *the* machine rather than adding one.

Three reasons it was rejected. The resume costs about **15 seconds** to serve the first request
after idling, against ~200ms warm. Fly exposes **no way to tune the idle delay** - the stop loop
runs on its own schedule and decides on excess capacity, and `idle_timeout` is an HTTP
connection setting rather than this one. And `register` floats its token issue and mail send
while `onApplicationShutdown` does not await that promise, so a stop landing in that window
answers 202 and never sends the email, recoverable only through "Resend link".

Reconsider it if the bill matters more than a first impression, or pair it with a scheduled
warm-up ping during the hours that matter.

### The Swagger UI is public on the deployed API

`SwaggerModule.setup` registers its routes on the HTTP adapter rather than as Nest controllers,
so the global `SessionGuard` never sees them and `/api/docs` needs no bearer. That was harmless
while the only reader was a developer on localhost; it is a deliberate exposure now that
`https://spendifico-api.fly.dev/api/docs` answers 200 to anyone. It leaks no data, only the shape
of the API, and it is genuinely useful to the frontend - but it should be a decision rather than
something discovered. Gating it would mean serving the document behind a route that the guard does
cover, or not serving it in production at all.

### `/api/health` still proves liveness only, not readiness

PET-66 replaced `/api/hello`, which had become the deploy health check by coincidence rather
than design, with a purpose-built `GET /api/health`. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s post-deploy
assertion and `backend/fly.toml`'s own check now curl something honestly named. It still proves
only that the process answers HTTP, deliberately: no DB ping, no migration state, no deployed
commit SHA or version - `fly.toml`'s own comment on the check already rules out touching the
database, because that would flap the machine on a transient Turso blip. A separate readiness or
status endpoint carrying that information, if ever wanted, needs its own ticket and a different
liveness/readiness split than the one used here.

### A reclaimed insight run can still overlap the run that replaced it

PET-56 made an abandoned `generating` row self-heal after `GENERATING_STALE_AFTER_MS`, and every
write in `runGeneration` is conditional on the row still being `generating`, so a reclaimed run
cannot resurrect its own row, stamp a stale `generated_at` over the newest set, or leave cards
hanging off a `failed` one. What the guard does **not** do is stop the two runs existing at once:
past the cutoff a new run starts while the old one may still be working, and the embedded driver
refuses overlapping transactions rather than queueing them, so one of the two completion
transactions can simply fail and mark its run `failed`. The user sees a regenerate that did not
take and retries; nothing is corrupted.

Unreachable while generation is rule-based, because a run settles in well under a second and
nothing can be five minutes stale while alive. It becomes reachable the moment a slow
`LlmInsightGenerator` lands behind the `INSIGHT_GENERATOR` seam, which is the case the cutoff was
sized for in the first place. The shape of the fix is the same one the overlapping-verify entry
above names: a per-user in-process queue around the run, the `issueQueue` pattern
`LoginTokenService` already uses. Reaching for a heartbeat column instead - a run proving liveness
so the cutoff never fires on a live one - is the alternative, and the more invasive of the two.

### The insights single-run index ignores tombstones, so a soft-deleted run would wedge it

`insight_sets_generating_idx` is partial on `status = 'generating'` and says nothing about
`deleted_at`, while every query around it filters `deleted_at IS NULL`: both `hasRunInFlight` and
the stale-run reclaim in `generate()` would skip a tombstoned `generating` row, but the index would
still be holding it. A soft-deleted run in that state therefore 409s every future `POST
/api/insights/generate` with no API path to clear it, which is exactly the wedge PET-56 removed for
the un-tombstoned case.

Unreachable today: nothing anywhere soft-deletes an insight set, and the only writer of that column
would be code that does not exist. It is recorded rather than fixed because
`categories_fallback_idx` has the identical asymmetry (partial on `is_fallback = 1`, while
`fallbackId` filters `deleted_at IS NULL`), so changing one and not the other would be worse than
leaving both consistent. If either is ever fixed, fix both, and the fix is to put the tombstone in
the index predicate rather than to take it out of the queries. Manual recovery in the meantime is
one statement: clear the row's `deleted_at`, or set its `status` to `failed`.

### A burst of transaction writes leaves one stale set, and it heals on the next write

`TransactionChangedListener` swallows the `ConflictException` a write gets when a run is already
in flight, on the reasoning that fresh-enough content is already being generated. Nothing re-runs
once that run completes: there is no retry, no dirty flag and no scheduled sweep, so when writes
2..N of a burst all lose the single-run guard, the surviving set is whatever the first run read
part-way through the burst. Deleting three transactions in a row from the list is the ordinary way
in - `/insights` and the dashboard teaser then both quote spend that includes rows the user has
already removed, until the account's next transaction write or a click on Regenerate.

**The listener and `backend/CLAUDE.md` both called this "self-healing" until the review of
PET-42-43-44, and that was wrong rather than loose**: a reader checking whether a burst could
leave stale content was being told a mechanism existed that does not. Both now say "heals on the
next write", and this entry is what "recorded rather than mitigated" was supposed to point at.

Not fixed here because every honest fix is a re-entrant loop on the write path - a dirty flag the
completing run re-reads and re-runs from, or a debounce - and generation is sub-second, so the
window is small and the manual escape is one click. It is the same fix the `LlmInsightGenerator`
entry below already needs before that swap, and it should be built once, for both.

**PET-73 fixed it, and the paragraph above was wrong about one word: a re-entrant loop is not the
only honest fix, a *bounded* one is.** `InsightsService.dirty` is a per-user flag the listener sets
on the 409 it used to only log; `runGeneration` **clears it as its own run starts**, and on the
success path a flag that is set again starts exactly one more run. Because each run clears the flag
on entry, a burst of N writes produces **at most two runs**, and there is no path that schedules a
third from the second - the follow-up clears it too, and by then the burst has settled. Only the
success path schedules: a failed or reclaimed run has not settled the state it would be scheduling
against, and chaining off one is how a bounded retry becomes an unbounded one. The flag is in memory
rather than in a column for the same reason `inFlight` is - it is process state about a floated run,
and a single instance is a deployment invariant. What this entry still points at for the
`LlmInsightGenerator` swap is **debouncing**, which is a different thing and is still owed.

### Generate-on-write was argued against here, and PET-42-43-44 reversed it

**This entry used to say a write path firing generation was "the tempting shortcut" and "the wrong
shape". It is what shipped, and the reversal is recorded rather than the entry deleted**, because
an argument that turned out to be wrong is more useful to the next reader than its absence.

What it said: `POST /api/insights/generate` worked and was called by nobody, so
`DashboardResponseDto.insight` was null for every account that existed and `InsightTeaserCard`'s
ready state was reachable only from Storybook. The fix was PET-44's "Regenerate" button becoming
real. A generate-on-write trigger was rejected on the grounds that generation is deliberately
asynchronous and one-run-at-a-time, so a write path firing it "would 409 against itself on any
burst of saves".

**The objection was factually right and did not reach the conclusion.** The 409 is real; it is also
benign, and it is swallowed and logged on the write path rather than surfaced - a 409 means
fresh-enough content is already being generated. The collision window is sub-second against
human-paced saves, and a collision costs the losing write's data being missing from that one set
until the next save. The coupling half of the objection is answered rather than overridden: the
write path emits an event and never learns that insights exist.

What the trigger bought is the thing the button could not. `state: 'empty'` now genuinely means the
account has never logged a transaction, which is what makes frame 16's copy honest and what let the
Insights page delete its mount trigger - a read-only screen that wrote to the database on every
visit, and 409'd against itself under React Strict Mode's dev double-mount.

**The reasoning depends on generation being sub-second, and that is the thing to re-check.** See
the next entry.

Two smaller things survive from the original. The teaser's pending copy is ours and owes A29
sign-off with the rest. And `Screens/04 Dashboard` fixtures the ready state because it is the frame
being diffed against node 21:4 - that is now a state the running app really produces, so the
story's comment saying otherwise is dated.

**A second reversal belongs here, PET-73's, because it is the same shape and about the same
field.** PET-25 argued that "PET-20's endpoint exists so that one call serves the whole screen" and
rejected the Dashboard making a second read for its insight content on those grounds. PET-73
reversed it: `DashboardResponseDto.insight` is **removed**, and the Dashboard reads
`GET /api/insights` directly. Two things answer the original argument. The dashboard summary is a
**snapshot with no way to update itself**, so an `insight` field on it goes stale exactly where the
poll's whole purpose is to not be - a set generating in the background would need a route refresh to
appear, on the one card whose entire job is to resolve without one. And PET-72 had already spent
that argument itself, by adding `readPeriods()` beside `readDashboard()` for the header's period
select; the screen was already making two reads before this one made it three. PET-25's argument is
kept above rather than deleted, which is this repo's convention for an argument that turned out to be
wrong.

### The assistant chat scrolls the page rather than a bounded message region

PET-73's plan assumed a fixed-height message list pinned between the tab bar and the composer, and
that is not what shipped. **What the chat does do** is scroll to its newest turn after every send,
failure and cancel - `insights/chatScroll.ts`, one `scrollTop` write on `document.scrollingElement`
and emphatically not `scrollIntoView`, for the reason `lib/pickerScroll.ts` records - so the newest
bubble and the composer are always in view. What it does **not** have is a region of its own.

The reason is the shell rather than the screen. The root layout is `flex min-h-full flex-col` and
`(app)/layout.tsx` is `flex flex-1 flex-col` on top of it, so **nothing in the chain has a definite
height**: a `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` child resolves against its content and never overflows,
which would make the `overflow` decoration and the scrollbar never appear. Bounding it means giving
the chain a real height, and that bounds the other three routed views too - each of which wants to
grow. So this is a layout decision for a screen with no Figma frame, and it wants designing rather
than guessing.

What it costs today: a very long conversation makes a very long page, and the tab bar scrolls away
with it. `chatScroll.ts` is where the rule lives if that changes - the one `scrollTop` write applies
to a bounded region exactly as it applies to the document.

### Deleting an assistant conversation is deferred, and the reason is not the endpoint

PET-73 ships `assistant_sessions` and `assistant_messages` with `deleted_at` on both and every read
filtering it, and **no** `DELETE /api/assistant/sessions/{id}` and no prune. That is a decision
rather than an omission, and the contrast with `insight_sets` is the whole of it: that table needed a
prune because a row was written per *transaction write*, so its growth tracked how much the user
spent - roughly 1,800 set rows a year at five expenses a day, in the user's own replica, every one
carried to Turso Cloud by the shutdown push. A conversation only exists because a human typed it, so
growth is bounded by use.

What it would take when somebody asks for it: a service method tombstoning the session (its messages
can stay, since every read joins from the session), a route, a `lib/` write with its taxonomy, and a
confirmation dialog - `(app)/ConfirmDeleteDialog.tsx` is the shared one, and `DeleteCategoryProvider`
is the screen-scoped provider shape a History list with N rows on one route would want. No schema
change, which is why deferring it costs nothing later.

### The assistant cannot answer a question about a past period's budget or caps

The prompt quotes the **current** period's budget and per-category caps, and deliberately not the
history behind them. Both are effective-dated since PET-72, so the honest alternative is sending
`budget_history` and `category_cap_history` too - and that is a second dataset with a join the model
has to perform in prose, against transaction rows that carry no period attribution of their own. The
prompt header names which period its figures are for, so the model does not silently answer a
question about last March with this month's limits; what it cannot do is answer that question at all.

The cheap version, if this turns out to matter, is not the histories: it is attributing each
transaction row to a period **in the digest**, one extra field per row, which lets the model group
without joining anything. That costs tokens on every turn for a question most users will not ask,
which is why it is here rather than shipped.

### An LLM generator needs a debounce before it can be bound

The write-path trigger above is safe because `RuleBasedInsightGenerator` settles in well under a
second, so two saves would have to land inside the same second to collide at all. Bind a real
`LlmInsightGenerator` to `INSIGHT_GENERATOR` and runs become multi-second: the collision window
widens to something ordinary typing pace reaches, every transaction write starts paying for a model
call, and a burst of saves spends one per keystroke-paced edit.

So the swap is **not** the one-line provider change the seam otherwise promises. It needs a debounce
or a dirty flag in front of the trigger first - mark the account's set stale on write and let a
single delayed run collapse a burst, rather than starting one per write. The read needs nothing:
`hasRunInFlight`'s staleness cutoff is already generous enough for a slow generator, which is what
it was sized for.

**PET-73 narrows this without closing it, and the distinction matters.** The dirty flag exists now,
so a burst no longer *loses* a write's data - but it bounds the loop rather than delaying it, and
what a slow generator needs is the delay: two runs per burst is fine at sub-second and expensive at
multi-second. **The debounce is still owed.** What that ticket does settle is that this entry
**blocks nothing it used to**: its chat is a separate module binding no generator, so
`INSIGHT_GENERATOR` is untouched and PET-73's `CATEGORY_CHANGED` needed no debounce either - the
objection there was "an LLM run per cap change is not cheap", and no LLM is bound.

### If `/insights` becomes a chat, the module boundary is the thing to get right

A plausible next shape for this feature moves the cards onto the Dashboard and turns `/insights`
into an interactive assistant. Most of what exists survives that unchanged: `InsightsService`, both
tables and the read stay as they are, and the Dashboard already composes the service for its teaser,
so moving the cards is a DTO field plus UI work rather than a migration.

What should **not** happen is the chat being folded into `insights`. A persisted set generated on a
schedule and a conversation held with a user share a vocabulary and nothing else - different
lifecycle, different storage, different failure modes, and `INSIGHT_GENERATOR` is a seam for
producing a stored set rather than for turning a question into an answer. A chat wants its own
module and its own segment name. `frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s Not built here already reserves an
`/api/chat` route handler, and it deliberately declares no model-provider key.

**PET-73 executed this, and the entry is kept as the record of why rather than deleted.** The
forecast held almost exactly: the cards moved to the Dashboard, `InsightsService` and both tables
are untouched, and the chat is `src/assistant/` - a separate module binding no generator, which is
the one thing this entry insisted on. Two details came out differently. It was **not** "a DTO field
plus UI work": `DashboardResponseDto.insight` was *removed* rather than kept, because the dashboard
summary is a snapshot with no way to update itself and the poll behind those cards exists precisely
to not be one - so the Dashboard reads `GET /api/insights` directly. And the reserved `/api/chat`
handler landed as `/api/assistant/messages`, for a reason this entry could not have known: it exists
so a turn can be **cancelled**, not merely because a browser has to call something.

### PET-26's five empty-state strings are designed copy, not A29's

Frame 05 (node 44:706) draws "Full month ahead" on the budget card, "No spending to chart yet" on
the trend card, "No transactions yet" and "Your recent expenses will appear here as you add them."
on the recent-transactions card, and "Your category breakdown appears here once you start
spending." on the donut. All five are read off the frame rather than invented for it, which is the
opposite of A29's item above: that one tracks copy this repo wrote because nothing was designed,
and PET-26's five strings are the designer's own words.

**What is owed.** Not a sign-off on the wording, which already exists - A30's copy pass, the one
that keeps Figma's UK "categorised" in the transactions empty state. Logged here anyway so a copy
review has one place to check every designed string that shipped, this list and A30's spelling
notes included, rather than only the ones this repo had to invent.

**Two of the five are now conditional, and the review of PET-26 is why.** "Full month ahead" draws
only when the account is empty **and** `daysLeft` is at least 28, because emptiness says nothing
about how far into a period the user is - an account that has logged nothing by the 28th of a
period beginning on the 1st has four days left, and the frame's sentence would be false over an
accurate count. And the donut's "Your category breakdown appears here once you start spending"
draws only when `spent` is 0; the dangling-category race reaches the same empty ring with real
money on it, where that sentence contradicts the figure in the middle of the ring. Both fall back
to copy this repo wrote, so **A29's invented-copy list gains two strings** - the donut's "No
category breakdown available" ring name and "This period's spending is not attributed to any
category." - while the budget card falls back to the days-left count it already draws in every
other state. A designer reading this list should know that two of the five designed strings are
reachable in fewer situations than frame 05 implies.

### The uncapped category card has no frame, and it is the common case rather than the edge

Frame 13 (node 36:423) draws eight capped categories and nothing else, but a monthly cap is
optional throughout the contract and the preselected `Uncategorized` fallback ships without one -
`CategoryResponseDto` documents `status: "uncapped"` with a null cap, percent, remaining and over,
and says to expect it most of the time. So the one category every account has is the one the
design never drew. PET-36 answers it the way PET-34 answered the same gap on the transaction
detail page: draw none of the budget furniture rather than explain its absence.

**What is owed.** Three strings and one layout, all invented here: the card's "{spent} in {n}
transactions" line, the banner reading "No limit set for this category", and its "Set limit"
action, plus the decision that an uncapped card keeps the same footprint as a capped one so the
grid does not go ragged. `Screens/13 Categories`' `AllUncapped` story is the whole state in one
place, which is what to put in front of a designer. Joins the A29 group with A15's no-results
copy, A38's verify-failure copy and the donut's two fallback strings: real until somebody looks
at it, not a placeholder.

The summary card's own banner - "{amount} of your budget isn't assigned to a category." with an
"Allocate" action - is a fourth invented string on the same screen, and it arrived for a different
reason: the ticket's AC4 was amended away from frame 13's "Budget allocation" summary toward a
spending summary, so the unassigned figure needed somewhere else to live. Same sign-off owed.

**That banner's action now opens a modal whose every string is invented too**, which is a longer list
than this entry anticipated when it called it a fourth string - see the Allocate modal's own entry
below for the enumeration and for the three decisions inside it. The banner's own sentence is
unchanged and still owes what this paragraph says it owes.

### `BudgetCard` hands `<progress>` a `max` that can be zero

PET-36's review found this on its own summary card and fixed it there:
`RegisterDto.monthlyBudget` is only `@IsPositive()`, so `0.40` is an accepted budget and
`Math.round` takes it to zero. A `<progress max="0">` is invalid, and the failure is silent
rather than loud - the HTML spec says to fall back to `max=1`, so the bar renders **empty**, and
announces 0%, beside a chip reading "Over budget" for an account that has overspent everything it
has. `categories/SpendingSummaryCard.tsx` now floors the max at 1 and clamps the value against
that same floor, so the overspent case fills the bar.

**`dashboard/BudgetCard.tsx` has the identical shape and was left alone**, deliberately:
`value={Math.min(spent, monthlyBudget)} max={monthlyBudget}` on an unrounded pair, reachable the
same way. It is PET-21's file and PET-36 had no business editing it, so the fix travels with
whoever next touches that card. Note the dashboard version is marginally worse, since it does not
round first: a budget of `0.4` reaches `max={0.4}`, which is valid HTML, so it fails only at
exactly `0`.

### The Categories tab pays one extra request for the other tab's badge

Frame 13 draws both tab counts on the Categories tab - "All transactions 128" beside
"Categories 8" - so the route that renders no transactions still has to say how many there are.
`/transactions` gets its half free, because it already reads the categories to join names and
colours onto the table's rows and the count is `categories.length` over data in hand.
`/transactions/categories` has no such luck and calls `readTransactionCount()`, which is one
unfiltered current-period list read whose only surviving field is `total`.

**What is owed.** Nothing urgent, and it is smaller than the redundant-request item above it: this
is one request per page load rather than one per debounced keystroke, and the endpoint is the
account's own list. The honest fix is a count the API can answer without building a page of rows,
which PET-28's plan considered and dropped because no frame drew two numbers - frame 13 does draw
two numbers, so the reason has expired. Logged so the next person costing this screen does not
have to rediscover why a screen with no transactions on it reads the transactions endpoint.

### `text-error` is 2.86:1 in the light theme, and PET-36 is where it became measurable

**PET-46 adds a link to that list rather than a second failing colour, and the choice was measured
rather than reasoned.** The Settings form's expired-session line carries a "Log in again" anchor
inside its own `role="alert"`, and the obvious `link link-primary` composites to **3.40:1** against
the dark card - a *new* failure, on the one line a reader in trouble has to follow. A bare `link`
inherits the paragraph's `text-error` instead and is distinguished by daisyUI's underline, so it
measures 5.53:1 in dark and rides on the 2.86:1 above in light: exactly as legible as the sentence
around it, and one problem to fix here rather than two. Whatever replaces `text-error` fixes the
link with it.

Frame 13 draws the over-budget figure in red and CTG-4 says so in as many words, so
`CategoryCard`'s footer takes `text-error` when a category is at or past its cap. PET-36's browser
walk measured it: composited over `bg-base-100` it is **2.864:1 in light** and **5.53:1 in dark**,
against WCAG AA's 4.5:1 for normal-size text. The bars themselves are fine - success, warning and
error measure 1.96, 1.76 and 2.86 against the card in light and 8.08, 8.98 and 5.53 in dark, which
clears the 1.5:1 floor PET-22 set for a bar after `base-300` failed it at 1.16.

**This is not PET-36's defect and PET-36 must not fix it locally.** `text-error` is daisyUI's
stock light `error` token, and it is already what `ui/Button`'s `textDanger` variant and every
field error message in this app paint - so the same 2.86:1 applies to the delete actions on frames
08, 11 and 21 and to every inline validation message. Darkening it means re-theming a semantic
colour, which `frontend/CLAUDE.md` forbids outright, and doing it in one component would leave the
app with two different reds.

**What is owed.** A decision that belongs to a designer and applies app-wide: accept 2.86:1 in
light, or change what "danger text" is made of. Worth noting the affected text is never
colour-alone - the figure reads "$12 over" and the chip beside it reads "Over", so WCAG 1.4.1 is
satisfied and it is 1.4.3 that is not. The measurement harness is in PET-36's plan; re-measure
rather than reuse these numbers if the theme ever changes, for the reason
`frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s category-palette guard gives.

**The same walk found a second stock pairing just under the line, and it is broader.**
`text-primary-content` on `bg-primary` measures **4.13:1 in dark** and 6.75:1 in light, against
the same 4.5:1 for normal-size text. PET-36's `CardBanner` is where it was measured, but that is
not where it lives: `btn-primary` sets `--btn-color: var(--color-primary)` and
`--btn-fg: var(--color-primary-content)`, so **every primary button in the app already paints
this pair** - "Get started", "Continue", "Finish setup", "Add transaction" at all four of its
trigger sites, and "Add category". A banner is simply the first place it was put under a
contrast meter.

Same owner and the same shape of answer as the `text-error` item above: accept it, or change what
the theme's primary pair is made of, which is a re-theme and therefore out of any single ticket's
reach. Both numbers are dark-and-light specific, so a theme change invalidates both.

### The Add category modal deviates from frame 19 twice, and both owe a designer

PET-37 built the modal at node 102:878 and departed from it in two visible ways, neither of which
a gate can catch because both are correct-looking.

**The budget field reads "Monthly budget (optional)" where the frame draws it bare.** Forced rather
than chosen: `CreateCategoryDto` makes `monthlyCap` optional, and A12 is this app's rule that a
required field is marked only by the absence of "(optional)" - so a bare label would make the one
optional money field in the app read as required. The alternative is a designed marker for optional
fields, which would be an app-wide change and is a designer's call rather than this ticket's.

**Focus opens on Name, not on the budget field the frame rings.** That frame draws a name, a budget
and a note all already typed, so the ring is a mid-fill snapshot rather than an on-open state, and
honouring it literally would land focus past an empty required field. `AddTransactionModal` honours
its own frame's focused field only because there it happens to be the first one. Worth confirming,
because it is the one deviation a designer would notice immediately and disagree with cheaply.

A third item is not a deviation but an invention: **the tile-and-name preview under the two selects
has no counterpart in the file at all.** AC2 asks that the chosen colour "previews on the category"
and nothing in frame 19 does that, so both the element and its placement are ours. It is
`aria-hidden`, since every fact in it is already announced by the three fields above it.

### The Icon picker is a searchable grid, and its search box is invented

PET-37's Icon field is `IconSelect`: the same trigger and platform popover as `ColourSelect`, holding a
**search box over a six-across scrolling grid** of every glyph the palette offers. A grid rather than a
list because 64 glyphs are looked for by *shape*, and a one-per-row list of names makes that eleven
screens of scrolling - which is what PET-65's plan meant when it observed that 64 grids evenly and noted
this picker had no design behind it.

**The search box has no counterpart anywhere in the design, and it is the part that needs signing off.**
Nor does the empty-search state, whose copy ("No icons match that.") is ours like everything else under
A29. `Screens/19 Add category`'s `IconPickerOpen` story is where both get reviewed, along with the grid
width, the cell size and the filled-primary chosen cell.

**It matches on the label *and* the lucide name**, deliberately: "Television" is `tv`, "Bank" is
`landmark`, "Bolt" is `zap`, and somebody typing has no idea which vocabulary they hold. Anything that
narrows this to one of the two makes glyphs unfindable.

**Two things about it that a reviewer should not simplify.** Enter in the search box is intercepted,
because `(app)/Modal.tsx` wraps the body in a real `<form>` so that Enter submits it - right for every
other field, and it would create the category from two letters of a search here. And the cells are
`w-full aspect-square p-0` rather than `btn-square`: a browser walk found that six fixed-width cells fit
`w-72` until the vertical scrollbar appears and takes 15px, at which point the grid overflowed sideways
and, because `overflow-y: auto` makes `overflow-x: visible` compute to `auto`, the panel grew a second
scrollbar along the bottom.

**What it does not have is two-dimensional keyboard navigation.** A real grid pattern wants arrows in
four directions, plus Home/End and `role="grid"`/`role="gridcell"`; Tab reaches every cell instead, and
the search box is what makes that bearable - type two letters and the cell you want is one Tab away.
That is the same refusal `ColourSelect` records below, and it is the bigger of the two to fix.

### The Color picker is a control of our own, and it owes three things

PET-37's Color field is `ColourSelect`, not `ui/Select`: a `<button>` trigger plus a `[popover]` list
drawing a swatch, a name and a tick on the chosen row. A native `<option>` cannot hold a swatch and
its tick is drawn by the operating system, so the designed list is simply unreachable from a native
control. Chromium's `appearance: base-select` would give both, but daisyUI 5.7.16 ships nothing for it,
so opting in resets the control and its popup to UA base styling and the result exists only in
Chromium - a control of our own is the smaller change and the portable one.

**Four things it costs, none of them fixed here.**

**Arrow keys do not work; Tab does.** No `role="listbox"` and no `role="option"`, because those roles
promise a keyboard contract - arrows, Home/End, type-ahead, `aria-activedescendant` - that this does
not implement. That is `TransactionRowMenu`'s refusal of `role="menu"` and `SetupShell`'s refusal of
`aria-current="step"`, made a third time. What ships is a list of ordinary buttons with `aria-current`
on the chosen one. Implementing the real listbox pattern is the fix, and it is a bigger piece of work
than the picker itself.

**The native mobile picker is gone for this one field.** `ui/Select`'s own note cites the platform
picker on a phone as a reason it chose a native control; a popover list is what a touch user gets
instead. Worth a look on a real phone before anyone calls this done.

**Firefox does not anchor it.** No CSS anchor positioning there, so daisyUI's
`@supports not (position-area: bottom)` fallback centres the panel over a dimmed backdrop. Degraded
rather than broken, and identical to the transactions row menu, which already carries this entry.

**Nothing in Figma draws either list open** (A16, A40), so the panel's width, the swatch size, the row
height, the tick and its position are all ours. `Screens/19 Add category`'s `ColourPickerOpen` story is
where a designer reviews them.

**The asymmetry this entry used to carry is closed**, and the note is kept rather than deleted because
the *reasoning* still holds. It said the Icon field stayed a native `<select>` and that the two controls
would therefore behave differently when opened, with a grid left to a later ticket. That grid is
`IconSelect`, built in the same PR - so both fields are now controls of ours, both wear `select`'s class
string when closed, and they differ from each other only in shape: a named list for sixteen colours, a
searchable grid for 64 glyphs. `ui/Select` is no longer imported by this modal at all.

### The Add category modal captures no note, and the field is hidden rather than removed

`AddCategoryModal` has a `SHOWS_NOTE` flag, set to **false**, so the Note field frame 19 draws and
CED-4 specifies is not rendered. The reason is A42, which the contract restates in
`CreateCategoryDto`: a category's note **surfaces on no screen once saved**. Asking somebody to write
a note that nothing ever shows back is asking them to write into a void, so the field waits for a
category detail page to show it on, the way `/transactions/[id]` shows a transaction's.

**Nothing was removed to achieve that, which is the whole point of the flag.** `categoryForm.ts`
still carries `note` in `CategoryFormValues`, still trims it and still omits it from the body when
blank, and `categoryForm.test.ts` still pins all three - so the conversion keeps its coverage and only
its input stopped being a control. `CreateCategoryDto.note` and the `categories.note` column are
untouched, so **no migration is owed in either direction**.

**Re-enabling it is one word plus four assertions.** Flip `SHOWS_NOTE` to true, and
`AddCategoryModal.test.tsx` will fail on exactly the cases that need their expectations back: the
field-order case, the "renders no Note field" case, the A12 one-optional-label case, and AC4's body.
That is deliberate - the suite is what tells the next person the full cost rather than leaving them to
find it.

**A flag rather than commented-out JSX**, because a commented block is not typechecked: renaming
`CategoryFormValues.note` or changing `ui/Input`'s props would leave it broken with the build green,
and whoever restored it months later would inherit the breakage. This way the markup compiles on
every build.

What is owed is the product decision this defers: whether a category ever gets a detail page, and if
not, whether the note should be dropped from the DTO and the column altogether rather than left as a
field nothing writes. Note the onboarding seed **does** write notes - each picked template copies its
`description` into the category's `note` - so the column is not dead data today even though the modal
no longer adds to it.

### The Add category picker offers no grey-out, and PET-65 is what changed the reasoning

The modal lets two categories carry the same colour and the same icon, silently, matching a backend
with no unique index on `name`, `color` or `icon`. When PET-37 was planned that was close to forced:
against the 13 icons PET-64 seeded, a full onboarding pick consumed **all** of them, so greying out
what was in use would have rendered every option of a required field disabled.

**PET-65 removed that argument by taking the set to 64, and the decision was kept anyway** - as
scope rather than as impossibility, which is a weaker reason and is recorded as such. What is owed
is a product answer: whether the picker should mark colours and icons already in use, and if so
whether it disables them or merely annotates them. The data is already in hand on that screen, so it
is a modal-side change with no backend part.

**The colour half stays awkward whatever is decided.** 17 tokens exist, 16 are offered, and Tailwind
cannot build a class from runtime data - so a seventeenth colour is a deploy rather than admin data,
and colour collisions past the thirteenth category remain forced where icon collisions no longer
are. Raising that ceiling is its own ticket and starts in `ui/categoryColour.ts`, not in the palette
tables.

### The Categories tab reads the palette on every view, for a modal that usually does not open

`transactions/categories/page.tsx` reads `GET /api/templates/palette` as a third parallel read
alongside the categories and the transaction count, so the Add category modal can take it as a prop.
The alternative - `AddTransactionProvider`'s route handler plus a hook plus a fetch on open - was
declined deliberately: that shape earns its three loading states by serving five triggers across
three routes, and this is one button on one route which was already awaiting two reads.

**The cost is one request per view of the tab whether or not anybody opens the modal**, and it is
paid in parallel so it adds no latency to the page. It is also the most cacheable read in the app:
the response is admin-managed template data, identical for every user, and changes only when an
admin edits it. Nothing caches it today, because `authorizedGet` sends `cache: 'no-store'` for every
caller and giving one read a different policy is a change to a shared helper. Worth revisiting
together with the redundant-request item the transactions screen already owes, rather than on its
own.

Note this joins, and does not replace, the extra-request item the same route already carries for the
other tab's badge: that tab now makes three reads, two of which are for something other than its own
cards.

### The category delete confirmation's six strings are ours, and two of them are load-bearing

PET-39's dialog owes A29 the same sign-off every invented state in this app owes, and the list is
longer than the transaction confirmation's because the endpoint answers one more status. Four
failure lines - `That category is already gone. Close this to see the current list.`, `That category
cannot be deleted: it is where deleting any other category moves its transactions.`, `Your session
has expired. Log in again to delete this.` and `We couldn't delete this category. Please try again.`
- plus **two body shapes**, one for a category with transactions in the period and one for a category
with none. `Shell/Delete category`'s stories render all six, which is the quickest thing to put in
front of a designer.

**Two of them must not be softened into "try again" during that review.** `missing` describes a
category the server no longer has, so a retry answers 404 forever; `fallback` describes a request the
backend refuses by design, so a retry is refused forever. Those two are the whole reason
`DeleteCategoryResult` has four arms rather than two, and collapsing either into the generic line
would give advice that cannot work.

**The body copy is also where two amendments to the ticket are visible**, and a copy review should
be told they are deliberate rather than drift: it says `Uncategorized` where CED-9 says "Other", and
it scopes the count to "this month" where CED-9 states it as a total. Both are recorded on the issue
with their reasoning.

### The two kebab glyphs are toned differently, and nobody decided that

`transactions/TransactionRowMenu.tsx` draws its `EllipsisVertical` with `text-base-content/40` and
`transactions/categories/CategoryCardMenu.tsx` draws the same glyph with no tone class at all, so
it takes `btn-ghost`'s own colour. The two kebabs sit one tab apart and read differently.

It surfaced when PET-39's review had the two menus lifted onto a shared `(app)/PopoverMenu.tsx`:
that component needs a `glyphClassName` prop whose only purpose is to keep this difference, which
is the smell that says the difference is unowned rather than designed. **The prop is a placeholder
for a decision, not the decision** - delete it once a designer picks one, and the two call sites
collapse to none.

Not resolved in that PR on purpose: either value is a visible change to one of the two screens, and
picking one to match the other is a design call rather than a refactor. Frame 10 and frame 18 are
what to hold side by side. PET-38 touched that menu and deliberately left this alone for the same
reason: making Edit live changed no glyph, and choosing a tone is still the designer's.

### The Allocate modal's ceiling holds only inside one open dialog

`AllocateBudgetModal` reads its budget, its caps and the reserve held by rows it does not draw
**once, on open**, and never resyncs - deliberately, because a `router.refresh()` behind the open
dialog would otherwise rewrite the fields under the user's hands mid-edit. So a monthly budget or a
cap changed anywhere else while the modal sits open leaves every ceiling computed against stale
figures, and the caps it then saves can sum above the current budget.

Nothing is wrong server-side when that happens: caps exceeding the budget is a state the API accepts
by design (A43), `allocation.unallocated` simply goes negative, and the summary card behind the modal
renders it. So there is no error to raise and no arm to add - which is exactly why this is recorded
rather than fixed. The honest fix is the server-side ceiling PET-70 rejected on the grounds that it
would make this endpoint disagree with `PATCH /api/categories/{id}`, which enforces none; the cheaper
partial fix is re-reading on open through a route handler, the way `(app)/useCategoryOptions.ts`
does, which shrinks the window to "while open" without closing it.

A review of PET-70 narrowed one consequence of the same never-resync decision, and it is worth
separating from the ceiling above because it was a defect rather than a limitation. A **deleted**
category is the one stale figure the server refuses outright, and the modal's answer to that 404 used
to leave Save enabled - so the retry its own copy invites re-sent the dead id and could only fail
identically, forever. Save is disabled once the server says the list is out of date, and the re-read
happens on close rather than in front of the open dialog. What is still recorded here is everything
the server accepts: a budget or another cap changed elsewhere raises no error, so there is nothing
for the modal to notice.

### A cap change can leave the insight set stale, and no category write regenerates

`RuleBasedInsightGenerator`'s over-cap rule reads category caps, so lowering a cap can make the
latest `ready` set describe a category as within budget when it is now over - and **no** category
write regenerates anything. `PATCH /api/categories/{id}` has never done so, and PET-70's bulk write
deliberately did not start, because emitting from one and not the other would make the same user
action behave differently depending on which modal performed it.

The clean version is a single `CATEGORY_CHANGED` event emitted from `create`, `update`, `remove` and
`setCaps`, with a listener in `InsightsModule` - `CategoriesModule` needs no new imports for it, since
`EventEmitterModule` is global and `InsightsModule` already imports `CategoriesModule`, so a direct
call would close the cycle the emitter exists to avoid. It wants building **with** the debounce or
dirty flag the `LlmInsightGenerator` swap already owes, above: a rule-based run per cap change is
cheap, and an LLM run per cap change is not.

**PET-73 built exactly that, and the last sentence turned out not to apply.** The event is emitted
from all four writes and `insights/insight-triggers.listener.ts` - renamed from
`transaction-changed.listener.ts`, because a file named after one of two events it handles is a
filename that lies - handles both through one private helper. **No debounce was owed after all**:
the objection was that an LLM run per cap change is not cheap, and no LLM is bound; the bulk cap
write is also one statement per modal save rather than one per keystroke. What the same ticket did
build is the bounded dirty flag above, which is why a cap change landing during a run no longer
loses its data either.

### The Allocate modal's copy is invented end to end, and three decisions inside it want a look

There is no Figma frame for this modal at all, so every string in it joins the A29 group rather than
being a diff against anything: the title and its subtitle, "Left to assign", the three ledger rows,
"Your monthly budget is set in Settings.", the column headers, the `No limit` placeholder, the
`{amount} spent · {amount} over this cap` caption, the footer hint, both snap messages and all five
failure lines. A review of PET-70 added two more: the line the list draws when the account has no
allocatable category at all, and the one refusing a payload past the endpoint's hundred-row bound.
`Screens/Allocate budget`'s seven stories are the whole of the review surface, `NothingToAllocate`
being the one that review added.

Three of those are decisions rather than wording, and each is where a designer could reasonably
disagree. **The snap message mixes precision on purpose** - `formatCurrency` for the capped amount
because it must match the field two centimetres away, which routinely carries cents, and
`formatWhole` for the budget because it must match the summary card behind the modal; one formatter
for both would contradict one of the two. **A ceiling of zero gets a different sentence entirely**,
"Nothing left to assign. Free up budget from another category first.", because "Capped at $0.00"
would be true and useless - and the field is cleared rather than set to zero, since a cap of zero is
one the API rejects. **Sub-pixel segments are accepted rather than floored**: a $1 cap against a
$3,200 budget is 0.03% of the bar and renders as nothing, and the obvious `min-w-px` was rejected
because it pushes the widths past 100% and flex then shrinks the *large* segments to compensate, so
the bar would stop being accurate everywhere to make one invisible segment visible.
`Screens/Allocate budget`'s `TinySegments` is that case.

### The Settings profile card invents five strings and three states, and A29 owes all of them

SET-5 draws no success, no error and no unsaved-changes visual anywhere on frame 17, so PET-46's
pending, failure and confirmation treatments are ours. Four of the strings are the failure lines -
`invalid` ("check the values", never "try again", because a body the DTO rejects loops forever),
`taken` ("That email address already belongs to another account."), `unauthenticated` and `failed` -
and the fifth is the success line, "Changes saved". The four *field* messages are not on this list:
they are copied byte for byte from `app/setup/register/RegisterForm.tsx`, which collects the
identical three fields under the identical three rules, so they are already whatever A29 makes them
there.

`Screens/17 Settings` carries three stories that exist to collect the answer rather than to diff
against the design: `WithMessages` puts all three inline messages up at once, `EmailTaken` shows the
409 line, and `Saved` shows the confirmation. Two of them are states an untouched form cannot reach.

### The logout control is invented end to end, and A39 was overruled rather than answered

**PET-84.** A39 says no frame in the design file draws a sign-out anywhere, including Settings, and
that both it and the email-change warning need a designer's answer before shipping. The product
owner overruled the first half rather than waiting for it, so the control exists and **every visible
decision about it is ours**: the sidebar footer as its home, `LogOut` from lucide as its glyph, "Log
out" as its accessible name, an icon-only button rather than a labelled row, and **no confirmation
dialog** - logging out destroys nothing and the way back is one email, so a dialog would be ceremony
on the one control whose whole job is to be quick. The email-change half of A39 is untouched and
still owed, and the entry about the old address never being notified is where that lives.

There is no story to collect the answer on, unlike the three `Screens/17 Settings` ones above:
`Components/Sidebar` already renders the panel and now renders this control in it, so the review
surface is the existing story rather than a new state. What a designer would change is the glyph, the
placement or the addition of a label, none of which needs a story that does not exist.

Worth knowing for whoever answers it: the control is deliberately **not** on Settings, and the
reason is mechanical rather than aesthetic. That page is one `<form>` with a page-level "Save
changes", so a button inside it either submits the profile PATCH or needs a `type="button"` guard for
a control that has nothing to do with the form, and it would be a fourth card on a screen whose suite
pins exactly three `h2`s. If a designer wants it there as well, the footer control is what a second
surface reuses.

### The Settings page has no unsaved-changes guard, by design

Navigating away from a half-edited Profile card discards it silently: no prompt, no dirty marker, no
"you have unsaved changes" anywhere. SET-5 designs none, and A29 designs no state that could carry
one, so inventing a `beforeunload` prompt would be a larger deviation than the three states PET-46
already invented. Recorded because it looks like an omission and is a decision, and because the
cheapest honest fix - marking the form dirty in the Save row - is one more undesigned state rather
than none.

The related choice **was** that Save stays enabled on a clean form, where `AllocateBudgetModal`
disables its own on `!isDirty` - on the reasoning that this modal has a designed disabled state and
this frame does not. **That was reversed by the product owner, and the reversal is the better call
for a reason the original missed.** The guards in the submit handler already made a clean press do
nothing, so the button was live, pressable and silently inert: a control that looks actionable and
is not, which is the exact failure every drawn-but-unbuilt control on the Categories tab was given
`aria-disabled` to avoid. Deviating from the frame by grey-ing a button is the smaller lie.

It is `disabled` rather than that screen's `aria-disabled`, and the difference is what the state
means: those controls are unbuilt and must stay focusable to announce why, while this one is built
and momentarily has nothing to do, which is the ordinary meaning of a disabled submit. It
re-enables on the next keystroke, so nothing is stranded, and it suppresses implicit submission so
Enter cannot do what the button will not. What still owes A29 a sign-off is the disabled treatment
itself, since the frame draws none - it is daisyUI's stock `btn` disabled state.

### The Settings form does not mirror `@MaxLength(100)`, so an over-long name gets generic copy

`settings/settingsForm.ts`'s `isNameValid` checks non-blankness and nothing else, which is
`categoryForm.isNameValid`'s recorded call about `@MaxLength(60)` applied to a second DTO: a bound
restated in the frontend is one that can drift from the backend's with every gate green. The cost is
that a name past 100 characters is rejected by the DTO and surfaces as the form-level `invalid`
line - "check the values" - rather than as an inline message naming the field and the limit. Closing
it wants the bound published somewhere both apps read, which is the same wish `CategoryPicker`'s
`@ArrayMaxSize` literal and `AllocateBudgetModal`'s `MAX_CAP_ROWS` already record: `maxLength`
reaches no generated type, so there is nothing to read it out of.

### Settings reads the profile twice per view

**Closed 2026-08-09 by PET-47, and by a route nobody predicted here.** Both alternatives this entry
weighed were about Settings, and neither is what happened: `requireProfile()` is wrapped in React's
`cache()`, so the two calls collapse to one `GET /api/profile` per render pass and both call sites
stay exactly as they were. The memo was not built for this - PET-47 needs the profile's currency in
every Server Component that formats money, which is what made a deduped read worth having at all -
so the fix arrived as a side effect of a feature rather than as the optimisation this entry declined
to do on its own. Two things about the closure. The property the entry was defending is intact:
`cache()` memoizes within a **single render pass**, so `router.refresh()` still re-reads and the
form's diff baseline is still the current profile. And the "may or may not collapse them" hedge
below stops mattering, because nothing now depends on what Next's fetch memoisation does with two
explicit no-stores. What is left is a small correctness gain rather than a saved request: the footer
and the form provably read one profile, where before they were two reads that could straddle a
concurrent write - which is the shared-initials rule (SET-6, PET-46 AC5) held by construction.

`(app)/layout.tsx` calls `requireProfile()` for the sidebar footer and `settings/page.tsx` calls it
again for the form. Both go through `authorizedGet` with `cache: 'no-store'`, so Next's per-request
fetch memoisation may or may not collapse them - same URL, method and headers, but an explicit
no-store on each.

Accepted rather than fixed, and the alternatives are both worse at this size. A layout cannot pass
props to the page it wraps in the App Router, so removing the second read means a profile context
mounted on all four routes to serve one screen - the shape `AddCategoryButton` already declined for
one trigger on one route. Threading it any other way would also cost the property the second read
buys: the form's diff baseline is the *current* profile on every render, which is what makes a
second press of Save after a successful one send nothing. `/transactions/categories` already fires
three reads inside a shell that read a fourth, so this is the second instance of a pattern rather
than a new one. Measure it in the Network panel before deciding it is real.

### Nothing on the Settings form warns that a new address moves the login link

The backend side of this is three entries up, under "Changing an email address leaves three loose
ends": no re-verification, live links still pointing at the old inbox, and no notification to the
address that lost the account. PET-46 puts the field on screen, which turns the third of those from
a latent property into something a user can trigger with a typo, and A39 designs no warning, no
confirmation step and no re-verification anywhere.

The whole of the frontend mitigation is one standing hint under the field, "Login links will be sent
here.", which is invented copy joining the A29 list above. What it cannot do is prevent the typo: a
mistyped-but-valid address is accepted, the account moves to an inbox nobody reads, and the current
session keeps working until it expires - at which point there is no way back in. A confirmation step
naming the new address is the cheap fix and contradicts A39 as drawn, which makes it a product
decision before it is a code one.

### Saving the last of the budget destroys the control that opened the modal

A third route to the focus-restore gap this file already carries for saving from an empty state and
for deleting a row: the Allocate banner renders only while `allocation.unallocated > 0`, so a save
that assigns the remainder removes the banner during `router.refresh()`, and `Modal`'s focus restore
aims at an element no longer connected. Focus lands on `<body>`, so the next Tab starts from the top
of the page. Walked in Chrome on PET-70. It joins the existing entry rather than opening a second
one, and the fix is the same one: a fallback target when the captured element has gone.

### Switching currency re-denominates silently, and nothing on screen says so

PET-47 made the profile's currency live (`USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`). Amounts are stored as integer cents
with no currency attached, so switching **re-labels rather than converts**: a 2,000 budget stays
2,000 and becomes €2,000, and every historical transaction re-labels with it, so a $12.40 coffee
logged last month renders as €12.40.

**This is the product owner's explicit decision, twice over** - re-denominate rather than convert,
and ship no warning copy for it. Recorded here rather than on screen because a decision nobody can
see is the kind this repo has learned to write down. Converting instead would need an FX rate
source, a backend endpoint, a pass over every transaction and category cap, and an answer to what
happens to historical accuracy - and is arguably wrong anyway, since it would rewrite what the user
actually spent.

What would close it without any of that is one line under the picker. It belongs with the other
copy A29 owes a designer.

### The budget field's focus ring is per-segment, where the design system lights the whole pill

`components/BudgetField.tsx` is daisyUI's `join`, so each `join-item` draws its own focus ring. The
team's Claude Design version moves the ring onto the **container**, so the whole control lights up
whichever half has the caret.

Not reproduced, and the reason is a rule rather than effort: a container-wide ring means authoring a
selector, which `frontend/CLAUDE.md` forbids outright for components. The shipped behaviour is also
arguably the better signal, because it says *which* half is focused. Owed a designer's sign-off with
the rest of A29's list; if they want the container ring, the honest options are a daisyUI feature
request or an explicit carve-out from the no-authored-CSS rule, not a quiet exception.

### A fifth picker with no arrow keys, and the count is now the argument

`settings/MonthStartField.tsx` joins `ColourSelect`, `IconSelect`, `TransactionRowMenu` and
`CategoryCardMenu` in declining `role="listbox"`/`role="option"`/`role="menu"`: those roles promise
arrow keys, Home/End, type-ahead and `aria-activedescendant`, and none of the five implements them.
Each is a list of ordinary buttons with `aria-current` naming the chosen row - Tab reaches every one,
Enter and Space pick.

**PET-47's own plan specified a real listbox here and the implementation deliberately did not**, so
this entry is where that reversal lives. Building the contract for one control would have given a
single picker in this app a keyboard model the other four lack, and the next person copying a picker
would have copied the wrong one. `IconSelect` already ships **64** rows on this pattern, so 28 is not
the case that breaks it.

What changed with this ticket is the arithmetic: five controls is past the point where "we have not
implemented it" is a smaller job than "we have implemented it inconsistently". When it is built it
should be built once - a shared roving-focus hook adopted by all five in one change - rather than per
control. The two costs stay as `ColourSelect` first recorded them: no arrow keys, and no native
mobile wheel picker.

### Three more invented states on Settings, and one of them is retroactive

A29 designs no copy for any of these, and PET-47 added them:

- **"Enter an amount greater than 0."** under the monthly budget - the same string
  `app/setup/BudgetForm.tsx` shows for the same rule, copied rather than shared.
- **"Every budget figure in the app is measured from this day."** under "Month starts on". This is
  the one worth a designer's attention rather than a rubber stamp: changing that value is
  **retroactive**, because the backend derives month attribution from each transaction's date at
  read time, so every figure in the app re-buckets the moment it saves. The hint understates that.
  **PET-72 made the second sentence false and the first one more of a problem**: a pay day is an
  effective-dated `period_rules` row now, so a change applies from the paycheck the dialog asks
  about and never backwards - which is the opposite of re-bucketing all history. The copy is
  unchanged and still says nothing about when the change starts, so what it owes a designer grew
  rather than shrank. The entry below is that half.
- **The currency picker's panel rows** - symbol, full name, code - which no frame draws at all.

### A schedule change lands on a period the screen never names, and both directions of that are silent

Both halves are the same missing sentence, both were found by walking PET-72 in a browser rather
than by any gate, and neither is a defect in the write - the row lands exactly where the dialog
said it would. What is missing is any statement of **which period it landed on**, on a screen whose
one visible figure is the account's *configured* value.

**Backwards: a retroactive save looks like a revert.** `GET /api/profile` reports the newest row of
each history, so anchoring a budget change at a paycheck older than the newest one succeeds while
the configured figure does not move. The form correctly adopts what the account now holds, so the
field the user just typed 1,234 into settles back to 2,400 under a green "Changes saved" - which is
the truth (May's row changed; today's budget did not) and reads exactly like a failed save. Note
this replaced a worse behaviour rather than introducing one: before the review of PR #84 the form
stayed permanently dirty instead, and a second press appended a duplicate row. `SettingsForm.tsx`'s
resync docblock carries that account.

**Forwards: a future-anchored save looks like nothing happened at all.** The dialog offers four
months ahead, and `POST /api/profile/schedule` accepts a T in the future by design - it stretches
the current period up to T and leaves it on the old budget. So the write lands, every figure on
every screen stays exactly as it was, and the only place the change is visible is a period the
period select does not offer yet, because `GET /api/periods` is bounded by the account's own
history and does not publish periods that have not started. A pay-day change is the sharper case:
"Month starts on" now reads 25 while every period boundary in the app is still on the 15th, and
nothing says the two disagree until December.

One sentence closes both, and it has to name the period rather than the date - "Applies from your
July 2026 paycheck" beside the confirmation, off the `label` the backend already publishes for
every period. That makes it the first success message in this app with a *variable* in it, which is
why it wants the notification system under HIGH IMPORTANCE above rather than a fifth hand-rolled
`role="status"` line on one screen. Until then the honest summary is that the feature is correct
and unobservable, and A29 owes the copy along with everything else invented on this screen.

### Settings reads the palette and the periods for a modal most visits never open

PET-48's follow-up made the Categories card's "Manage" open the Manage categories modal, and the two
sub-modals behind it need a colour/icon palette and a period list. So `settings/page.tsx` now awaits
`readPalette()` and `readPeriods()` alongside `readCategoriesView()` on **every** visit to Settings,
for a dialog that most visits never open.

This is the same trade `transactions/categories/page.tsx` already took for its own palette, and the
entry above about that one is the same fact from another side. Both buy away a route handler, a hook,
and the null-versus-failed-versus-loading triple `AddTransactionModal` has to model for a modal that
can open from anywhere. Neither is free, and `Promise.all` means the page waits for the slowest -
which is why `readPalette` carries its own timeout and why adding a read with none to that array is
the thing to think about rather than the count.

The fix, when it is worth taking, is the shape `app/api/categories/route.ts` already sets: a route
handler the modal fetches from on open. What that costs is the three loading states, which is exactly
what both pages declined to model.

**Both degrade rather than throw, and the periods one is a deliberate departure.** `lib/periods.ts`
rejects on failure by design, because on `/transactions/categories` a period-less header over
period-scoped figures is a screen that lies. Settings catches it, because there the periods back one
question inside an unopened modal and `requireProfile()` is the only read on that page with an
opinion about whether the session is alive. It is sound rather than merely convenient -
`EditCategoryModal` already guards an absent current period by sending the cap with no anchor - but
it does mean a Settings visit during a periods outage silently loses the "from which paycheck"
question on a cap edit. `(app)/pages.test.tsx` pins the arm; nothing tells the user.

### Settings counts categories one lower than the Transactions tab badge, by decision

The Categories summary card excludes the `Uncategorized` fallback from its count; the tab badge in
`TransactionTabs` counts every live category and documents itself as never 0 for that reason. So one
account reads "13 categories" on Settings and "14" on the Categories tab, which was measured in
PET-48's browser walk rather than reasoned about. The product owner chose it: the card is about the
categories a user manages, and the fallback is the one they cannot - it draws no kebab and no banner,
and the entry above about it being neither renamable nor cappable from the UI is the same fact from
another side.

The seam it leaves is small and real. `allocation.allocated` is passed through verbatim rather than
re-summed - it is the same figure the Categories tab's summary card and the Allocate modal read, and
a private `reduce` here would be a second authority on one number - and that figure **includes** a
cap on the fallback if one were ever set. No screen offers that, `PATCH /api/categories` accepts it,
and `allocateForm.ts`'s `reservedCents` is what recovering it looks like when a caller genuinely
needs to. Until then the count and the sum disagree about one row that contributes zero.

### Two more invented states on Settings, both PET-48's

A29 designs neither, and both are collected by `Screens/17 Settings` stories rather than left to be
described:

- **"We couldn't load your category totals just now."**, the card's degraded line, shown when the
  categories read fails. It claims nothing about why, because the read collapses a dead session, a
  dead backend and a 500 into one answer on purpose. Story: `CategoriesUnavailable`.
- **"0 categories · $0 allocated of $2,000"**, which an account holding only the fallback reaches.
  Every word of it true and none of it drawn. Story: `NoCategories`.

## Scaling, when it is actually needed

None of these matter at current scale. They are recorded so the limits are known rather
than discovered.

- **Connection cache is unbounded.** `UserDatabaseService` keeps every opened user database
  in a `Map` with no eviction. An LRU with an idle timeout is the obvious next step.
- **No cross-process migration lock.** A single backend instance is assumed. Two instances
  opening the same user database for the first time could both run its migrations.
- **Enumeration resistance is argued, not measured.** With the mail send floated off the
  request, every path through the two auth routes answers after at most one indexed read
  and one write into the local central database, so the timing difference should be
  negligible. The weakest spot is `register` against a verified account, which answers
  after the read alone - the only path that skips the write entirely, and therefore the
  most distinguishable one. Nobody has profiled the residual. If this ever has to be more
  than best-effort, it needs a measurement rather than an argument.
- **Login links and sessions are never purged.** Used, superseded and expired rows
  accumulate in `login_links` forever, and so do expired and revoked rows in `sessions` -
  one per login per device, none of which anything removes. Harmless at this scale, and the
  same purge policy that covers tombstones can cover both.
- **The embedded driver cannot overlap transactions.** One connection per database, and a
  second `db.transaction()` while one is open fails with "cannot start a transaction
  within a transaction" rather than queueing. `LoginTokenService.issue()` chains its own
  transactions in-process; a second transactional call site would need the same care, or
  a shared queue pushed down into the database layer.
- **Soft deletes are never purged.** Every table carries `deleted_at` for future sync, and
  reads filter it, but nothing removes tombstones. A purge policy is deferred until the
  sync design needs one. `transactions` is the first table a user can actually delete from
  through the API, so it is where this stops being theoretical: `DELETE
/api/transactions/:id` answers 204 and the row stays. PET-27's AC3 said "no soft-delete
  record"; that wording was re-derived from the delete dialog's copy without the sync
  consideration, and a hard delete risks row resurrection under delete-update conflicts once
  devices hold replicas. The tombstone is invisible through every endpoint, which is what
  "permanently" means to a client.
- **`toCents()` and `fromCents()` assume two-decimal currencies.** `src/common/money.ts` is
  `Math.round(v * 100)` and `v / 100`: fine for USD and EUR, wrong for JPY (zero decimals)
  and KWD (three). The API accepts any ISO 4217 code, so fixing it means a per-currency
  exponent table rather than a change at those two call sites. Note the blast radius grew
  with PET-27: it was one profile field written once at verification, and it is now every
  transaction amount in both directions, so a wrong exponent would misreport every number
  the dashboard shows rather than just a budget. PET-45 added a second dimension to it:
  `PATCH /api/profile` lets a user change `currency` at will, while nothing rescales the
  cents already stored under the old one. Switching EUR to JPY today keeps every stored
  integer and simply relabels it, which is arguably the least surprising behaviour but is a
  decision nobody made - whatever the exponent table does, it also has to say what a
  currency change means for existing rows.
- **The transaction list is unbounded, by design and only for now.** `GET /api/transactions`
  returns every match in one response, because A11 and TRN-6 record that the design has no
  pager anywhere and the table simply scrolls. Fine at a few hundred rows a month and not fine
  forever: nothing caps the response, so a long-lived account eventually serializes its whole
  history on every page load. The natural next step is a `limit` with a `hasMore` flag, and
  `total` already exists as its own field precisely so that day does not silently turn TRN-2's
  badge into a page count - a frontend reading `transactions.length` would do exactly that.
  Whoever adds it also has to decide what the period filter's default means for a first page.
- **Offline conflict policy is undecided.** The schema is shaped for last-write-wins
  (UUIDv7 keys, epoch-ms timestamps, tombstones), but no client syncs yet and clock skew is
  unaddressed.

## Housekeeping

- **`docs:check` cannot see a shorthand path, so a citation of a deleted file survives it.**
  Check 4 resolves every backticked *repo-root-relative* path, which is the convention
  `docs/agents/conventions.md` sets - but the agent files are full of deliberate shorthand
  (`ui/Button`, `lib/format.ts`, `app/setup/draft.ts`), and the regex never looks at those. PET-57
  deleted six components and the code review that followed found five citations of them left in
  permanent docs and comments, none of them mechanically catchable: `frontend/src/app/CLAUDE.md`
  wrote `ui/ListRow.tsx`, and two were inside `.ts` comments, which the script does not read at
  all. All five are fixed; the gap that let them through is not. The fix is a check that tries a
  shorthand path against a small set of known bases (`frontend/src/`, `backend/src/`) and fails
  only when it looks like a file - contains a `/` and an extension - and resolves under none of
  them. Deliberately not done in the review commit: a first run would have to be triaged across
  several hundred references, and getting that wrong turns the one check that keeps these files
  honest into a step people learn to skip. Extending it to comments in `frontend/src/**` and
  `backend/src/**` is the same shape and doubles the value.
- **Repo-wide `prettier --check` is commented out in CI.** 55 files predate the Prettier
  config and the step would fail on a fresh clone. To enable: run `npx prettier --write .`
  once, commit that, then uncomment the step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Note that
  `.lintstagedrc.js` only formats files under `backend/` and `frontend/`, so root-level
  Markdown such as this file is not covered by the pre-commit hook and has to be formatted
  by hand.
- **The swagger plugin renders `@IsPositive()` as `minimum: 1`.** Right for an integer,
  wrong for anything with decimals, and it publishes a constraint the API does not
  actually enforce. `RegisterDto.monthlyBudget` carries an explicit
  `@ApiProperty({ minimum: 0, exclusiveMinimum: true })` to correct it, and PET-27 added the
  second and third compliant fields, `amount` on both `CreateTransactionDto` and
  `UpdateTransactionDto`, PET-45 a fourth in `UpdateProfileDto.monthlyBudget`; any future
  money field needs the same line, and
  `test/openapi.e2e-spec.ts` now pins every one of them against a regression. Check the generated `backend/openapi.json` when adding a DTO
  rather than assuming the derived constraints are faithful - `@ArrayMaxSize` is simply
  dropped, for instance, which is a smaller version of the same thing. Two more gaps of the
  same permissive shape were closed by PET-45, which had to publish the same two fields a
  second time on `UpdateProfileDto` and would have shipped both defects twice:
  `currency` now carries `pattern: '^[A-Za-z]{3}$'` with the ISO 4217 list named in its
  description rather than a 180-entry enum that drifts the moment the standard does, and it
  is case-insensitive because the DTO uppercases before validating; `monthStartDay` now
  carries `@ApiPropertyOptional({ type: 'integer' })`, with the derived `minimum`/`maximum`
  merging in beside it. The two DTOs are written byte-identically and an
  `it.each(['RegisterDto', 'UpdateProfileDto'])` pins both, because one schema drifting from
  the other is exactly how a shared field goes wrong. A third gap is cosmetic
  rather than permissive: `TransactionResponseDto.createdAt`/`updatedAt` are ISO 8601
  instants but publish as bare `type: string` with no `format: 'date-time'`, because the
  plugin cannot read that out of a doc comment. Harmless today - the generated TypeScript
  type is `string` either way - but if PET-28's read DTOs want the published contract to
  say what the string is, each instant field needs an explicit
  `@ApiProperty({ format: 'date-time' })`.
- **The Storybook story smoke harness is duplicated three times** (down from four: PET-57
  deleted the Foundations copy with its section). The same ~30 lines of
  story discovery and `renders without throwing` live in
  `frontend/src/components/ui/ui.stories.test.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/shell.stories.test.tsx`
  and, since PET-8, `src/app/screens.stories.test.tsx`. Each exists because it asserts its own
  section's title prefix - `/^Components\//`, `/^Shell\//`, `/^Screens\//` - and that
  assertion is the one thing each is there to make unambiguous. Three copies is at the
  lift-it-into-a-helper threshold. The shape: one exported function taking the `MODULES` array and a
  title-prefix `RegExp`, returning nothing and registering the three `describe` blocks, so each
  suite shrinks to an import, a `MODULES` literal and one call. Lifting three existing suites
  was out of scope for the ticket that added the fourth; do it before a fifth section appears,
  which PET-9 onward will not need but a future "Modals" section would. PET-9 added a module to
  `screens.stories.test.tsx` rather than a section, as predicted. Whoever
  lifts the helper should carry over two behaviours that copy has now had to document - it
  applies no `decorators`, so anything a story needs must live in its `render`, and a screen
  reaching `useRouter` needs `next/navigation` mocked in the suite.
- **The `@/` alias does not work inside `jest.mock()`, and it is not the route group's
  parentheses.** `jest.mock('@/lib/session')` fails with "Cannot find module" from anywhere,
  which PET-8 reproduced from `src/app/` and `src/lib/` with no parentheses in the path. The
  resolved Jest config carries no `moduleNameMapper` entry for `@/*` and a null `modulePaths`,
  so the alias is simply unresolvable at runtime; plain `import`s work because SWC rewrites
  aliased specifiers at transform time from tsconfig `paths`, while `jest.mock`'s argument is a
  string the resolver sees verbatim. Use a relative specifier, and name the same specifier in
  the accompanying `import` so the pair reads as one thing. `app/(app)/layout.test.tsx` used to
  blame the parentheses and now records the real cause; CLAUDE.md's "Two Jest traps come from
  the parentheses" note was corrected to one. Adding
  `moduleNameMapper: { '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1' }` to `jest.config.ts` would fix it
  repo-wide and is worth doing next time somebody is in that file.
- **`created_at` and `updated_at` can differ by a millisecond on insert.** Every table
  defaults the two from independent `$defaultFn(() => new Date())` calls, so an insert that
  straddles a millisecond boundary writes two different values - observed on a local
  transaction create as `.824Z` against `.825Z`. Harmless in itself, but it means
  `updatedAt === createdAt` is **not** a sound test for "never edited", and any code or test
  tempted to use it needs a tolerance instead. PET-27's e2e originally asserted equality and
  passed only by luck; it now asserts a sub-50ms window. Making them genuinely identical
  would mean the service passing one timestamp explicitly into both columns, which fights
  `$onUpdateFn` and deviates from the schema-level default every other table uses - not worth
  it unless something real needs exact equality.
- **No operation documents a 500, deliberately.** Resolved with PET-14: every route can 500
  through `AllExceptionsFilter`, so per-operation documentation restated the same
  non-actionable fact everywhere and widened every generated response union. The document
  description says it once instead, and `test/openapi.e2e-spec.ts` pins that no operation
  declares a 500. Keep new endpoints consistent with that.
- **Nothing stopped one `DATABASE_DIR` from serving both persistence modes, and the failure was
  silent.** Resolved with PET-61: `turso-client.factory.ts` now refuses in both directions before
  either client is constructed, checking for the sync engine's `-info` sibling rather than giving
  the two modes different filenames, which would have stranded whatever was already on the Fly
  volume. PET-60 hit the hazard before the guard existed - a local seed run put
  `dummy@spendifico.eu` in the central replica, a later cloud run pushed everything except that
  row, and the deployed backend could not find the account, answering the usual empty 202 and
  mailing nothing - and diagnosing it took comparing the local replica against Turso row by row,
  because every local check looked healthy. PET-61's own probe against the installed sync engine
  found the hazard was worse than PET-60's write-up: adoption can overwrite the plain file's rows
  rather than merely leave them unpushed, and the reverse direction (local mode writing to a real
  replica) is just as destructive, not merely undocumented. `backend/src/database/CLAUDE.md` and
  `docs/guides/seeding-dummy-data.md` describe the guard now; the repair for a directory mixed
  before PET-61 - delete the central replica and let it re-bootstrap - still applies.

### The cloud reset has no dry-run, and no backup behind it

PET-71 turned the manual "wipe everything" sequence into `mise run reset:cloud`
(`scripts/reset-databases.sh`). What it does not have is a rehearsal: there is no `--dry-run`
that prints the plan without executing it, so the only preview is the confirmation block
listing the counts and the resolved targets, and the only guard is having to type the project
name back. A
dry-run is genuinely useful here because the expensive mistake is running it against the wrong
Fly app or the wrong Turso organization, and both are read out of files rather than typed - so
the confirmation shows you what it resolved, but you have to actually read it.

There is also no backup. Turso database deletion is immediate and the Fly volume is destroyed
rather than snapshotted, so a reset aimed at the wrong target is unrecoverable. That is
accepted for a project whose accounts are all test accounts (see the no-migrations entry
above), and it stops being acceptable the moment anybody real registers. Whoever changes that
should add the dry-run and a pre-flight export in the same ticket, since either alone gives a
false sense of safety.

One narrower gap worth naming: the script tolerates a 404 when deleting a database, which is
what makes it re-runnable after a mid-way failure, but that same tolerance means a typo in the
derived central database name would delete nothing and still report success on that step. The
`database_type: "tursodb"` assertion on the recreate is what actually catches a wrong name, one
step later.

### The cloud reset's failure branches are reviewed, not run

`reset:cloud` was run end to end on 2026-08-11 and its happy path is now exercised twice, but
the `die` branches that run fixed that day are not covered by either run. They fire only when
`flyctl` itself fails - a `machine stop` that does not stop, a `machine destroy` that leaves the
machine, a `volume destroy` that fails while the volume is still attached - and nothing
available locally makes `flyctl` fail on demand.

This matters more than an ordinary untested-branch note, because two of those branches exist
specifically to convert a **silent** wrong outcome into a loud one, and their previous versions
were `|| true`. So the code that stops a reset from quietly not resetting is exactly the code no
run has entered. Testing it properly needs a fake `flyctl` on `PATH` returning non-zero for a
chosen subcommand, which is a small harness and a reasonable thing to add the next time this
script is touched. Until then, treat edits to steps 4 and 9 as unprotected by anything but
review.

### A template seed change only reaches an already-seeded central database through a reset

`openCentralDatabase` seeds `colour_templates`, `icon_templates` and `category_templates`
programmatically at boot, guarded on "any `category_templates` row exists". The guard is not
only idempotence - it is what stops a restart re-creating a template an admin deliberately
deleted (`backend/src/database/CLAUDE.md`). The consequence is easy to miss and has been
missed twice: **editing the seed constants and deploying does nothing at all** to an
environment whose central database is already seeded. The new rows simply never appear, with
no error and no log line.

Until the super-admin write path exists, the only mechanism that applies a seed change to a
live environment is `mise run reset:cloud`, which recreates central and therefore re-seeds it -
at the cost of every account. That is fine while all accounts are test accounts and wrong
afterwards. The real fix is the admin panel the templates were moved into central for, or
failing that a narrower "sync templates" path that adds rows absent from the table without
resurrecting deliberately deleted ones - which needs a tombstone on the template rows to tell
those two cases apart.

### An overloaded Gemini reaches the client as a generic 500

`POST /api/assistant/messages` documents **503** for "the assistant is not configured on this
deployment" and **504** for "the model call did not finish in time". An upstream
`503 UNAVAILABLE` - Google's own "This model is currently experiencing high demand" - matches
neither, so it falls through `AllExceptionsFilter` as an unhandled exception and the caller sees
the generic 500.

The consequence is a user-facing one rather than a tidiness one: a transient "try again in a
moment" is indistinguishable from a real bug, and the composer offers no retry affordance for a
500 the way it could for a named transient failure.

Observed on 2026-08-12 while recording `docs/showcase/ai-vs-sql.md`: **three of nine turns failed
this way in one sitting**, first as 503s and then, on retry, as two 504 timeouts - so this is not
a rare edge. `AssistantCompletionService` is where the SDK's `ApiError` would be inspected;
mapping a 503 upstream to a 503 outward is small, but it widens the endpoint's documented error
set and the frontend's failure taxonomy, so it wants its own ticket rather than a drive-by.
