# Database

Everything about the data on disk: what runs locally with no setup, how to try the access flow
end to end, how to change the schema, and how to point the backend at Turso Cloud.

Why it is built this way - the two driver modes, why the CLI cannot see a per-user database, why
there is no `db:migrate` script - is in `backend/src/database/CLAUDE.md`.

## Database

The backend persists to SQLite through [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) on
[Turso](https://turso.tech)'s engine, and each user gets a database of their own. A small
central database holds the user directory (email plus a pointer to that person's
database); everything else about a person lives in their database.

**For local development there is nothing to set up.** With no `TURSO_*` variables the
backend writes plain files under `backend/databases/`, creates them on first run and
applies the committed migrations itself. That directory is gitignored, so deleting it is
always safe: the next start rebuilds it.

```bash
cd backend && npm run start:dev

# `categories` takes category template ids, not names. Ask the public endpoint for
# them - it needs no session, because onboarding step 2 runs before an account exists.
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/templates/categories | jq -r '.categories[] | "\(.id)  \(.name)"'

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"fullName":"Marko Kovac","email":"marko@email.com","monthlyBudget":2000,"monthStartDay":1,"categories":["<a-template-id>"]}'
# 202 with an empty body, backend/databases/app.db now holds the row and the
# issued link, and the terminal running the backend prints the login link.
# An id that is not a live template is a 400, so a stale copy-paste fails loudly.
# `"categories": []` is also valid - A4 enforces no minimum.
```

Note what is _not_ created: no file for this user yet. Registration writes only the central
row and stashes the onboarding values on it; the user's own database is created when the
emailed link is verified, so an unauthenticated endpoint can never provision one.

Verifying is what completes the account. Copy the `token=` value out of the printed link:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/verify \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"token":"<the token from the link>"}'
# 200 {"token":"<session>","expiresAt":"..."}, and backend/databases/users/ now holds
# this person's own database, with their profile and picked categories in it

curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/auth/session \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <session>'
# 200 {"userId":"...","email":"...","expiresAt":"..."}
```

Spending the same link twice answers `401`, and a link that a newer one replaced answers
`409` - request two links and verify the older one to see it. Inspect either database with
`npm run db:studio:central` or `npm run db:studio:user`; the profile stores money in cents,
so a budget of 2000.50 reads as `200050`.

### Changing the schema

Edit `backend/src/database/central/schema.ts` (the user directory) or
`backend/src/database/user/schema.ts` (one person's data), then:

```bash
cd backend && npm run db:generate
```

That writes a new migration under `backend/drizzle/`. **Commit it.** There is no
`db:migrate` command on purpose: the app applies migrations itself, the central database
at startup and each user's database the first time it is opened, which is the only thing
that works when there are N of them.

### Connecting it to Turso Cloud (optional)

Only needed if you want real cloud databases. One-time setup with the
[Turso CLI](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction):

```bash
turso auth login
turso group create decode-pet                       # holds every database

# --tursodb is required, not optional. See the note below.
turso db create spendifico-app --group decode-pet --tursodb

turso db show spendifico-app --url                     # -> TURSO_CENTRAL_DB_URL
turso db tokens create spendifico-app                  # -> TURSO_CENTRAL_DB_TOKEN

# -> TURSO_ORG_TOKEN. Scoped to the group and to the three things the backend
# actually does, rather than a token that can do anything in your org.
# --org is mandatory whenever --group is given; without it the CLI (v1.0.31)
# refuses with "Error: --group requires --org" rather than assuming the current
# org. Your slug is the one `turso org list` marks as current.
turso auth api-tokens mint spendifico-backend --org <your-org-slug> --group decode-pet \
  --scope db:create --scope db:delete --scope db:mint-token
```

Fill those into `backend/.env` along with `TURSO_ORG` (your org slug, from
`turso org list`), and uncomment them. It is all four or none: half-filled fails at boot
rather than silently falling back. From then on the backend creates a database per
registered user in the same group, keeps a synced local copy under `DATABASE_DIR`, and
tests still run against plain local files.

**Why `--tursodb` matters.** It selects the Turso engine, a Rust rewrite of SQLite, instead
of the older libSQL engine that Turso Cloud still creates by default. The local half of
`@tursodatabase/sync` is a real Turso database, so the remote it replicates against has to
be one too. Getting this wrong is quiet rather than loud: the app still starts and appears
to work, and you find out later. **The engine is fixed when the database is created**, so
the fix is always "delete it and make a new one", which stops being cheap the moment real
data exists. Check an existing one with `turso db list`, whose `TYPE` column reads `Turso`
rather than `SQLite`. The backend passes the equivalent flag itself for every per-user
database it creates, so this only applies to the central one you make by hand.

**If your `.env` predates the Spendifico rename (PET-51), clear your local state first:**

```bash
rm -rf backend/databases
```

The rename replaced the central database and the per-user name prefix, so those files are
synced replicas of a remote that no longer exists, pointed at by a URL that no longer
resolves. Leaving them is the bad kind of wrong: nothing errors on startup, you simply have
a local copy that can never reconcile with its remote. The directory is gitignored and
rebuilt from the migrations, so deleting it costs nothing but your local dev account, which
you re-create by registering again.

`mise run reset` is that same delete, if you would rather not remember the path.

### Running locally when you also have cloud credentials

Once `backend/.env` carries the four `TURSO_*` variables, local work needs one deliberate
step, because the repo is not consistent about them and cannot be.

`mise run seed` and the showcase invite scripts **scrub** `TURSO_*` when they run in local
mode, so they always act on local SQLite files. The dev server does **not**: it reads what
the file gives it and connects to Turso Cloud. Run both with a cloud `.env` in place and you
get a locally seeded database that the app you are looking at never reads, which presents as
missing data rather than as a configuration mistake.

So before local testing, move the file aside rather than editing it:

```bash
mv backend/.env backend/.env.cloud     # keep it; restore when you want cloud again
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env   # local mode, no credentials
```

One related trap if you switch back and forth: `reset:cloud` recreates the central database,
so any embedded-replica directory created before a reset carries history from a database that
no longer exists and fails with "revision from future". Point `DATABASE_DIR` at a fresh
directory after any reset. The seed can report success while its final push fails.

### Template data and the seed guard

The central database also holds template data - which starter categories onboarding offers,
and which colours and icons a category may carry. The seeder is **guarded**: it skips any
central database that has already been seeded.

That guard is correct for repeated deploys and surprising the first time you change the
template data, because **a deploy does not apply the change**. Editing the colour, icon or
category seed and shipping it leaves the deployed app serving the old templates, with no
error anywhere - the deploy succeeds, the seeder runs, and the guard declines. Applying it
takes a deliberate step against the deployed central database.

This has been missed silently twice. If you change any of that seed data, plan the manual
step in the same change rather than after someone notices.

### Resetting everything to a clean state

Test accounts accumulate as one Turso database per person plus rows in the central
directory. Two commands clear them, and they are deliberately separate because they are not
equally forgiving.

```bash
mise run reset         # local SQLite files only, no credentials needed
mise run reset:cloud   # every Turso database and the deployed app's volume
```

`reset:cloud` **destroys production data**: every account, transaction, category and
session, with no backup and no undo. It prints what it is about to do and asks you to type
the project name before touching anything. It also refuses to run at all without a real
terminal to read that confirmation from, so it cannot be driven from CI, from an agent, or
through a shell that pipes stdin - run it from a terminal window.

**Why the order inside it matters, and why you should not improvise your own.** The Fly
volume holds embedded *replicas*, not caches, and they sync in both directions - the client
pushes then pulls on a timer, and the shutdown hook does a final push on every open replica.
Deleting rows in Turso while the machine is running therefore lets the replica push them
straight back, so the cleanup silently undoes itself. The script stops the machine before
the first Turso call and replaces the volume rather than reusing it. It also captures the
image digest that is already deployed and redeploys exactly that, so a reset can never ship
whatever happens to be checked out.

**It needs `TURSO_API_TOKEN`, which is not a backend environment variable.** The app's
`TURSO_ORG_TOKEN` is scoped to `db:create`, `db:delete` and `db:mint-token`, so it cannot
list databases - the Platform API answers 403 - and the reset has to enumerate them. Create
a full-access API token at [app.turso.tech](https://app.turso.tech) under Account, API
Tokens, then either export it or add it to `backend/.env.local`, which is gitignored:

```bash
export TURSO_API_TOKEN=...
```

This project's own token is named **`decode-pet-admin`** in the Turso UI, and is scoped to
the `decode-pet` group rather than to the whole account. That is deliberate and it is
sufficient: every database the reset touches lives in that group, and the `read` scope is
what satisfies the list call the app's token cannot make. **Rotate it whenever its value has
been anywhere it should not have been** - a chat transcript, a screenshot, a paste into an
issue. Replace the value rather than deleting the line, since the next reset needs it.

It is deliberately absent from `.env.example` and from the Joi schema in
`backend/src/config/env.validation.ts`. The application must never hold a credential that
can delete databases, and a variable in that schema is one the app is expected to have.

Two things it does on your behalf that are easy to forget by hand. The central database is
recreated with the Turso engine rather than the libSQL default, and the script reads the new
database back and asserts `database_type: "tursodb"` before continuing, because that choice
is fixed at creation and getting it wrong is silent. Note the readback: the create response
reports the engine under no key at all, so asserting on the create body cannot work. And the
freshly minted data-plane token is verified with a real query - retried, because the data
plane 404s a brand-new namespace for the first few seconds - then written to both the Fly
secret and every backend env file that already carries the key.

**The last step waits, and the wait is not slack.** The app migrates and seeds its local
embedded replica, and pushes to Turso Cloud only on the `TURSO_SYNC_INTERVAL_S` timer. So for
up to one interval after the redeploy, the cloud copy holds no application tables - measured
at 50 seconds on a fresh volume. The script therefore checks the API first, which answers
immediately, and then polls Turso Cloud for up to three intervals. Reaching that second check
also proves the replica-to-cloud push works end to end, which nothing else here covers.

**"Every backend env file" means exactly two: `backend/.env` and `backend/.env.local`,** and
only where the key is already present - the reset never adds `TURSO_CENTRAL_DB_TOKEN` to a
file that did not have it, because a file in local mode has to stay in local mode. Any other
copy of that credential goes stale the moment a reset runs, silently: a second machine, a
password manager entry, a CI secret, or a stash outside the repo. There is no mechanism that
finds those, so rotate them by hand, and prefer keeping one copy over keeping a convenient
one. This is not hypothetical - `backend/.env` used to point at
`~/.config/spendifico/backend.env.cloud` as a second stash, and the pointer outlived the
file.

`reset:cloud` does **not** touch your local files, and `reset` does not touch anything
remote. Run both if you want everything clean. Afterwards the central template tables are
re-seeded from current code, which is also the only way a change to the colour, icon or
category seeds reaches an already-seeded database.
