# Troubleshooting

Symptom first. If something here sends you to another guide, the fix lives there.

## The repo and both apps

| Symptom                                                   | Cause                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http://localhost:3000/` returns 404                      | Correct. A global `api` prefix means the route is `/api/health`. The prefix is set once in `backend/src/main.ts`                                     |
| A screen renders but shows no real data                   | Expected for now. Nothing in `frontend/src` fetches the backend yet, so every screen is placeholder data until the session cookie lands              |
| `node: command not found`, but it worked via the AI agent | Claude Code can ship its own bundled Node, which your terminal does not see. Install Node yourself, see [Prerequisites](installation.md#prerequisites)              |
| Servers die as soon as the AI assistant finishes          | Expected. Processes an assistant starts belong to its session. Start `npm run start:dev` and `npm run dev` in your own terminals and leave them open |
| Commits go through with no lint or message check          | You skipped the root `npm install`, so the hooks were never installed. Check with `ls .husky/_`, **not** `git config core.hooksPath` - that reads back the same whether or not the directory exists |
| ESLint cannot find its config                             | You ran it from the repo root. Each app's ESLint runs from that app's directory                                                                      |
| Ports look backwards                                      | They are asymmetric on purpose: backend **3000**, frontend **4200**. Both are wired into code and config, so do not swap them                        |
| `mise: command not found` after installing it             | You skipped the shell activation line. See [Installing mise](installation.md#optional-mise)                                                              |
| `mise run audit` lists vulnerabilities but still succeeds | Deliberate: it is a report, not a gate. See [Auditing and updating dependencies](commands.md#auditing-and-updating-dependencies)                                |
| mise gives you a different Node major than CI             | `mise.toml` and `.nvmrc` both pin the major and must be bumped together. mise does not read `.nvmrc`, so the two are independent                     |
| CI fails on "OpenAPI spec is up to date"                  | You changed a request or response shape without regenerating. Run `npm run api:sync` from the repo root and commit both files it writes              |
| The spec has a response of `{}`                           | The shape is an `interface`, or its class is not in a `*.dto.ts` file. Both make the generator's plugin skip it, and neither is an error             |
| The machine locks up while tests run                      | Two full jest suites at once exhausts RAM. Run **one suite per call** and always pass `--maxWorkers`; it froze this machine twice on 2026-08-12, the second time from a single session chaining both app suites with dev servers left idling |
| A dev server keeps running after the task that started it | Kill it immediately rather than at the end of a session. Note `pkill -f 'next dev'` does **not** match the frontend server, so match the real process or the port                                     |

## The GitHub CLI

| Symptom                               | Fix                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gh: command not found`               | Not installed. See [Installation](installation.md#optional-the-github-cli). On macOS restart the terminal after `brew install` |
| `gh auth status` says not logged in   | Run `gh auth login`. In a container or over SSH, add `--web` or use a token via `GH_TOKEN` |
| `HTTP 403` when posting a review      | Your token lacks `repo`, or you lack write access to that repository                       |
| git still asks for a password on push | You answered "No" to the credential-helper prompt. Re-run `gh auth login` and answer Yes   |
| Two accounts, wrong one is used       | `gh auth switch`                                                                           |

## Deploying to Fly.io

Fixes are in [Deployment](deployment.md); this table only maps the symptom.

| Symptom                                                       | Cause                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fly machine list` shows two machines                         | A deploy ran without `--ha=false`, which defaults to true. Two replica sets is a correctness failure, not a cost surprise. Destroy the spare        |
| The shutdown log opens but never closes                       | The flush was cut off and writes are being lost on every restart. `kill_timeout` is too low, or you passed `--timeout` to `fly machine stop`        |
| A migration error naming `drizzle/`, but the app booted fine  | `drizzle/` is missing from the image. It is resolved from `process.cwd()`, so it must sit beside `dist/`. Check `fly ssh console --command "ls /app/drizzle"` |
| `EACCES` on `mkdir /data/databases` at boot                   | A non-root `USER` was added to the Dockerfile without a `chown`. Fly mounts volumes root-owned                                                      |
| Every auth request 429s, from every caller                    | `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` is too low for Fly's real hop count (2), so `req.ip` resolves to a constant and all callers share one bucket                     |
| A tethered/second-network request still gets 429 against an exhausted bucket | Same root cause. `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` is not resolving the real caller in production - see the per-IP check in [Deployment](deployment.md) |
| The app crash-loops right after a `fly secrets unset`         | You unset half a validated pair. `MAILPACE_API_TOKEN` needs `MAIL_FROM`, and the four `TURSO_*` are all-or-none                                     |
| The machine stays stopped after `fly machine stop`            | Expected: `auto_start_machines` is false on purpose, so traffic will not wake it. Run `fly machine start`                                           |
| Every request 503s and the machine reads `stopped`             | Same cause, and a deploy does **not** start a stopped machine - it only updates its config. `fly machine start <id>`                                |
| `fly config show` errors with "no machines configured"        | It reads from a running machine, so it cannot work on an app that has never deployed                                                                |
| The deployed API rejects the frontend's browser request        | `FRONTEND_URL` allows exactly one CORS origin, and no Vercel preview URL will ever match it                                                        |
| A login link connects but `/auth/verify` 404s                  | Expected until PET-52 builds that route. Post the token to `POST /api/auth/verify` in the meantime                                                   |
| CORS fails only for visitors without `www`                    | Exactly one origin is allowed and it is the `www` form. The apex must redirect to `www`, not serve the app                                          |
